      <p>There are men who are capable of loving a machine more deeply than they canlove a woman. They are among the
        happiest men on earth. This is not a sneermeanly shot from cover at women. It is simply a statement of notorious
        fact.Men who worry themselves to distraction over the perfecting of a machine areindubitably blessed beyond their
        kind. Most of us have known such men.Yesterday they were constructing motorcars. But to-day aeroplanes are in
        theair—or, at any rate, they ought to be, according to the inventors. Watch theinventors. Invention is not usually
        their principal business. They must inventin their spare time. They must invent before breakfast, invent in the
        Strandbetween Lyons's and the office, invent after dinner, invent on Sundays. Seewith what ardour they rush home
        of a night! See how they seize a half-holiday,like hungry dogs a bone! They don't want golf, bridge, limericks,
        novels,illustrated magazines, clubs, whisky, starting-prices, hints about neckties,political meetings, yarns,
        comic songs, anturic salts, nor the smiles that aresituate between a gay corsage and a picture hat. They never
        wonder, at a loss,what they will do next. Their evenings never drag—are always too short. Youmay, indeed, catch
        them at twelve o'clock at night on the flat of their backs;but not in bed! No, in a shed, under a machine, holding
        a candle (whose pathsdrop fatness) up to the connecting-rod that is strained, or the wheel that is outof centre.
        They are continually interested, nay, enthralled. They have amachine, and they are perfecting it. They get one
        part right, and then anothergoes wrong; and they get that right, and then another goes wrong, and so on.When they
        are quite sure they have reached perfection, forth issues themachine out of the shed—and in five minutes is
        smashed up, together with alimb or so of the inventors, just because they had been quite sure too soon.Then the
        whole business starts again. They do not give up—that particularwreck was, of course, due to a mere oversight; the
        whole business starts again.For they have glimpsed perfection; they have the gleam of perfection in theirsouls.
        Thus their lives run away. 'They will never fly!' you remark, cynically.Well, if they don't? Besides, what about
        Wright? With all your cynicism, haveyou never envied them their machine and their passionate interest in it?You
        know, perhaps, the moment when, brushing in front of the glass, youdetected your first grey hair. You stopped
        brushing; then you resumedbrushing, hastily; you pretended not to be shocked, but you were. Perhaps youknow a more
        disturbing moment than that, the moment when it suddenlyoccurred to you that you had 'arrived' as far as you ever
        will arrive; and youhad realised as much of your early dream as you ever will realise, and therealisation was
        utterly unlike the dream; the marriage was excessively prosaicand eternal, not at all what you expected it to be;
        and your illusions weredissipated; and games and hobbies had an unpleasant core of tedium andfutility; and the
        ideal tobacco-mixture did not exist; and one literarymasterpiece resembled another; and all the days that are to
        come will more orless resemble the present day, until you die; and in an illuminating flash youunderstood what all
        those people were driving at when they wrote suchunconscionably long letters to the Telegraph as to life being
        worth living ornot worth living; and there was naught to be done but face the grey,monotonous future, and pretend
        to be cheerful with the worm of ennuignawing at your heart! In a word, the moment when it occurred to you
        thatyours is 'the common lot.' In that moment have you not wished—do you notcontinually wish—for an exhaustless
        machine, a machine that you could neverget to the end of? Would you not give your head to be lying on the flat of
        yourback, peering with a candle, dirty, foiled, catching cold—but absorbed in thepursuit of an object? Have you
        not gloomily regretted that you were bornwithout a mechanical turn, because there is really something about
        amachine...?It has never struck you that you do possess a machine! Oh, blind! Oh, dull! Ithas never struck you
        that you have at hand a machine wonderful beyond allmechanisms in sheds, intricate, delicately adjustable, of
        astounding andmiraculous possibilities, interminably interesting! That machine is yourself.'This fellow is
        preaching. I won't have it!' you exclaim resentfully. Dear sir, Iam not preaching, and, even if I were, I think
        you would have it. I think I cananyhow keep hold of your button for a while, though you pull hard. I am
        notpreaching. I am simply bent on calling your attention to a fact which hasperhaps wholly or partially escaped
        you—namely, that you are the mostfascinating bit of machinery that ever was. You do yourself less than justice.
        Itis said that men are only interested in themselves. The truth is that, as a rule,men are interested in every
        mortal thing except themselves. They have a habitof taking themselves for granted, and that habit is responsible
        for nine-tenthsof the boredom and despair on the face of the planet.A man will wake up in the middle of the night
        (usually owing to some form ofdelightful excess), and his brain will be very active indeed for a space ere hecan
        go to sleep again. In that candid hour, after the exaltation of the eveningand before the hope of the dawn, he
        will see everything in its true colours—except himself. There is nothing like a sleepless couch for a clear vision
        ofone's environment. He will see all his wife's faults and the hopelessness oftrying to cure them. He will
        momentarily see, though with less sharpness ofoutline, his own faults. He will probably decide that the anxieties
        of childrenoutweigh the joys connected with children. He will admit all the shortcomingsof existence, will face
        them like a man, grimly, sourly, in a sturdy despair. Hewill mutter: 'Of course I'm angry! Who wouldn't be? Of
        course I'mdisappointed! Did I expect this twenty years ago? Yes, we ought to save more.But we don't, so there you
        are! I'm bound to worry! I know I should be betterif I didn't smoke so much. I know there's absolutely no sense at
        all in takingliqueurs. Absurd to be ruffled with her when she's in one of her moods. I don'thave enough exercise.
        Can't be regular, somehow. Not the slightest use hopingthat things will be different, because I know they won't.
        Queer world! Neverreally what you may call happy, you know. Now, if things were different ...' Heloses
        consciousness.Observe: he has taken himself for granted, just glancing at his faults andlooking away again. It is
        his environment that has occupied his attention, andhis environment—'things'—that he would wish to have
        'different,' did he notknow, out of the fulness of experience, that it is futile to desire such a change?What he
        wants is a pipe that won't put itself into his mouth, a glass that won'tleap of its own accord to his lips, money
        that won't slip untouched out of hispocket, legs that without asking will carry him certain miles every day in
        theopen air, habits that practise themselves, a wife that will expand and contractaccording to his humours, like a
        Wernicke bookcase, always complete butnever finished. Wise man, he perceives at once that he can't have these
        things.And so he resigns himself to the universe, and settles down to a permanent,restrained discontent. No one
        shall say he is unreasonable.You see, he has given no attention to the machine. Let us not call it a
        flying-machine. Let us call it simply an automobile. There it is on the road, jolting,screeching, rattling,
        perfuming. And there he is, saying: 'This road ought to beas smooth as velvet. That hill in front is ridiculous,
        and the descent on theother side positively dangerous. And it's all turns—I can't see a hundred yardsin front.' He
        has a wild idea of trying to force the County Council to sand-paper the road, or of employing the new Territorial
        Army to remove the hill.But he dismisses that idea—he is so reasonable. He accepts all. He sits clothedin
        reasonableness on the machine, and accepts all. 'Ass!' you exclaim. 'Whydoesn't he get down and inflate that tyre,
        for one thing? Anyone can see thesparking apparatus is wrong, and it's perfectly certain the gear-box wants
        oil.Why doesn't he—?' I will tell you why he doesn't. Just because he isn't awarethat he is on a machine at all.
        He has never examined what he is on. And at theback of his consciousness is a dim idea that he is perched on a
        piece of solid,immutable rock that runs on castors.</p>

      <h6 style="margin-bottom: 10%;">AMATEURS IN THE ART OF LIVING</h6>
      <p>Considering that we have to spend the whole of our lives in this humanmachine, considering that it is our sole
        means of contact and compromise withthe rest of the world, we really do devote to it very little attention. When I
        say'we,' I mean our inmost spirits, the instinctive part, the mystery within thatexists. And when I say 'the human
        machine' I mean the brain and the body—and chiefly the brain. The expression of the soul by means of the brain
        andbody is what we call the art of 'living.' We certainly do not learn this art atschool to any appreciable
        extent. At school we are taught that it is necessary tofling our arms and legs to and fro for so many hours per
        diem. We are alsoshown, practically, that our brains are capable of performing certain usefultricks, and that if
        we do not compel our brains to perform those tricks we shallsuffer. Thus one day we run home and proclaim to our
        delighted parents thateleven twelves are 132. A feat of the brain! So it goes on until our parentsbegin to look up
        to us because we can chatter of cosines or sketch the foreignpolicy of Louis XIV. Good! But not a word about the
        principles of the art ofliving yet! Only a few detached rules from our parents, to be blindly followedwhen
        particular crises supervene. And, indeed, it would be absurd to talk to aschoolboy about the expression of his
        soul. He would probably mutter amonosyllable which is not 'mice.'Of course, school is merely a preparation for
        living; unless one goes to auniversity, in which case it is a preparation for university. One is supposed toturn
        one's attention to living when these preliminaries are over—say at the ageof about twenty. Assuredly one lives
        then; there is, however, nothing new inthat, for one has been living all the time, in a fashion; all the time one
        has beenusing the machine without understanding it. But does one, school and collegebeing over, enter upon a study
        of the machine? Not a bit. The question thenbecomes, not how to live, but how to obtain and retain a position in
        which onewill be able to live; how to get minute portions of dead animals and plantswhich one can swallow, in
        order not to die of hunger; how to acquire andconstantly renew a stock of other portions of dead animals and
        plants in whichone can envelop oneself in order not to die of cold; how to procure theexclusive right of entry
        into certain huts where one may sleep and eat withoutbeing rained upon by the clouds of heaven. And so forth. And
        when one hasrealised this ambition, there comes the desire to be able to double theoperation and do it, not for
        oneself alone, but for oneself and another.Marriage! But no scientific sustained attention is yet given to the
        real businessof living, of smooth intercourse, of self-expression, of conscious adaptation toenvironment—in brief,
        to the study of the machine. At thirty the chances arethat a man will understand better the draught of a chimney
        than his ownrespiratory apparatus—to name one of the simple, obvious things—and as forunderstanding the working of
        his own brain—what an idea! As for the skill toavoid the waste of power involved by friction in the business of
        living, do wegive an hour to it in a month? Do we ever at all examine it save in anamateurish and clumsy fashion?
        A young lady produces a water-colourdrawing. 'Very nice!' we say, and add, to ourselves, 'For an amateur.' But
        ourliving is more amateurish than that young lady's drawing; though surely weought every one of us to be
        professionals at living!When we have been engaged in the preliminaries to living for about fifty-fiveyears, we
        begin to think about slacking off. Up till this period our reason fornot having scientifically studied the art of
        living—the perfecting and use of thefiner parts of the machine—is not that we have lacked leisure (most of us
        haveenormous heaps of leisure), but that we have simply been too absorbed in thepreliminaries, have, in fact,
        treated the preliminaries to the business as thebusiness itself. Then at fifty-five we ought at last to begin to
        live our lives withprofessional skill, as a professional painter paints pictures. Yes, but we can't. Itis too late
        then. Neither painters, nor acrobats, nor any professionals can beformed at the age of fifty-five. Thus we finish
        our lives amateurishly, as wehave begun them. And when the machine creaks and sets our teeth on edge, orrefuses to
        obey the steering-wheel and deposits us in the ditch, we say: 'Can'tbe helped!' or 'Doesn't matter! It will be all
        the same a hundred years hence!'or: 'I must make the best of things.' And we try to believe that in accepting
        thestatus quo we have justified the status quo, and all the time we feel ourinsincerity.You exclaim that I
        exaggerate. I do. To force into prominence an aspect ofaffairs usually overlooked, it is absolutely necessary to
        exaggerate. Poeticlicence is one name for this kind of exaggeration. But I exaggerate very littleindeed, much less
        than perhaps you think. I know that you are going to pointout to me that vast numbers of people regularly spend a
        considerable portionof their leisure in striving after self-improvement. Granted! And I am glad ofit. But I should
        be gladder if their strivings bore more closely upon the dailybusiness of living, of self-expression without
        friction and without futiledesires. See this man who regularly studies every evening of his life! He hasgenuinely
        understood the nature of poetry, and his taste is admirable. Herecites verse with true feeling, and may be said to
        be highly cultivated. Poetryis a continual source of pleasure to him. True! But why is he alwayscomplaining about
        not receiving his deserts in the office? Why is he worriedabout finance? Why does he so often sulk with his wife?
        Why does he persistin eating more than his digestion will tolerate? It was not written in the bookof fate that he
        should complain and worry and sulk and suffer. And if he was aprofessional at living he would not do these things.
        There is no reason why heshould do them, except the reason that he has never learnt his business, neverstudied the
        human machine as a whole, never really thought rationally aboutliving. Supposing you encountered an automobilist
        who was swerving andgrinding all over the road, and you stopped to ask what was the matter, and hereplied: 'Never
        mind what's the matter. Just look at my lovely acetylene lamps,how they shine, and how I've polished them!' You
        would not regard him as aClifford-Earp, or even as an entirely sane man. So with our student of poetry.It is
        indubitable that a large amount of what is known as self-improvement issimply self-indulgence—a form of pleasure
        which only incidentally improvesa particular part of the machine, and even that to the neglect of far
        moreimportant parts.My aim is to direct a man's attention to himself as a whole, considered as amachine, complex
        and capable of quite extraordinary efficiency, for travellingthrough this world smoothly, in any desired manner,
        with satisfaction not onlyto himself but to the people he meets en route, and the people who areovertaking him and
        whom he is overtaking. My aim is to show that only aninappreciable fraction of our ordered and sustained efforts
        is given to thebusiness of actual living, as distinguished from the preliminaries to living.</p>

      <h6 style="margin-bottom: 5%;">III</h6>
      <h6 style="margin-bottom: 10%;">THE BRAIN AS A GENTLEMAN-AT-LARGE</h6>
      <p>It is not as if, in this business of daily living, we were seriously hampered byignorance either as to the
        results which we ought to obtain, or as to the generalmeans which we must employ in order to obtain them. With all
        our absorptionin the mere preliminaries to living, and all our carelessness about living itself,we arrive pretty
        soon at a fairly accurate notion of what satisfactory living is,and we perceive with some clearness the methods
        necessary to success. I havepictured the man who wakes up in the middle of the night and sees the
        horridsemi-fiasco of his life. But let me picture the man who wakes up refreshedearly on a fine summer morning and
        looks into his mind with the eyes of hopeand experience, not experience and despair. That man will pass a
        delightfulhalf-hour in thinking upon the scheme of the universe as it affects himself. Heis quite clear that
        contentment depends on his own acts, and that no power canprevent him from performing those acts. He plans
        everything out, and beforehe gets up he knows precisely what he must and will do in certain foreseencrises and
        junctures. He sincerely desires to live efficiently—who would wishto make a daily mess of existence?—and he knows
        the way to realise thedesire.And yet, mark me! That man will not have been an hour on his feet on thisdifficult
        earth before the machine has unmistakably gone wrong: the machinewhich was designed to do this work of living,
        which is capable of doing itthoroughly well, but which has not been put into order! What is the use ofconsulting
        the map of life and tracing the itinerary, and getting the machineout of the shed, and making a start, if half the
        nuts are loose, or the steeringpillar is twisted, or there is no petrol in the tank? (Having asked this question,I
        will drop the mechanico-vehicular comparison, which is too rough and crudefor the delicacy of the subject.) Where
        has the human machine gone wrong? Ithas gone wrong in the brain. What, is he 'wrong in the head'? Most
        assuredly,most strictly. He knows—none better—that when his wife employs aparticular tone containing ten grains of
        asperity, and he replies in a particulartone containing eleven grains, the consequences will be explosive. He
        knows,on the other hand, that if he replies in a tone containing only one little drop ofhoney, the consequences
        may not be unworthy of two reasonable beings. Heknows this. His brain is fully instructed. And lo! his brain,
        while arguing thatwomen are really too absurd (as if that was the point), is sending down ordersto the muscles of
        the throat and mouth which result in at least eleven grains ofasperity, and conjugal relations are endangered for
        the day. He didn't want todo it. His desire was not to do it. He despises himself for doing it. But hisbrain was
        not in working order. His brain ran away—'raced'—on its ownaccount, against reason, against desire, against
        morning resolves—and therehe is!That is just one example, of the simplest and slightest. Examples can
        bemultiplied. The man may be a young man whose immediate future depends onhis passing an examination—an
        examination which he is capable of passing'on his head,' which nothing can prevent him from passing if only his
        brainwill not be so absurd as to give orders to his legs to walk out of the housetowards the tennis court instead
        of sending them upstairs to the study; if only,having once safely lodged him in the study, his brain will devote
        itself to thepages of books instead of dwelling on the image of a nice girl—not at all likeother girls. Or the man
        may be an old man who will live in perfect comfort ifonly his brain will not interminably run round and round in a
        circle ofgrievances, apprehensions, and fears which no amount of contemplation candestroy or even ameliorate.The
        brain, the brain—that is the seat of trouble! 'Well,' you say, 'of course it is.We all know that!' We don't act as
        if we did, anyway. 'Give us more brains,Lord!' ejaculated a great writer. Personally, I think he would have been
        wiser ifhe had asked first for the power to keep in order such brains as we have. Weindubitably possess quite
        enough brains, quite as much as we can handle. Thesupreme muddlers of living are often people of quite remarkable
        intellectualfaculty, with a quite remarkable gift of being wise for others. The pity is thatour brains have a way
        of 'wandering,' as it is politely called. Brain-wanderingis indeed now recognised as a specific disease. I wonder
        what you, O businessman with an office in Ludgate Circus, would say to your office-boy, whomyou had dispatched on
        an urgent message to Westminster, and whom youfound larking around Euston Station when you rushed to catch your
        week-endtrain. 'Please, sir, I started to go to Westminster, but there's something funny inmy limbs that makes me
        go up all manner of streets. I can't help it, sir!' 'Can'tyou?' you would say. 'Well, you had better go and be
        somebody else's office-boy.' Your brain is something worse than that office-boy, something moreinsidiously potent
        for evil.I conceive the brain of the average well-intentioned man as possessing thetricks and manners of one of
        those gentlemen-at-large who, having nothingvery urgent to do, stroll along and offer their services gratis to
        someshorthanded work of philanthropy. They will commonly demoralise anddisorganise the business conduct of an
        affair in about a fortnight. They comewhen they like; they go when they like. Sometimes they are
        exceedinglyindustrious and obedient, but then there is an even chance that they will shirkand follow their own
        sweet will. And they mustn't be spoken to, or pulled up—for have they not kindly volunteered, and are they not
        giving their days fornaught! These persons are the bane of the enterprises in which theycondescend to meddle. Now,
        there is a vast deal too much of the gentleman-at-large about one's brain. One's brain has no right whatever to
        behave as agentleman-at-large: but it in fact does. It forgets; it flatly ignores orders; at thecritical moment
        when pressure is highest, it simply lights a cigarette and goesout for a walk. And we meekly sit down under this
        behaviour! 'I didn't feellike stewing,' says the young man who, against his wish, will fail in hisexamination.
        'The words were out of my mouth before I knew it,' says thehusband whose wife is a woman. 'I couldn't get any
        inspiration to-day,' saysthe artist. 'I can't resist Stilton,' says the fellow who is dying of greed. 'Onecan't
        help one's thoughts,' says the old worrier. And this last really voices thesecret excuse of all five.And you all
        say to me: 'My brain is myself. How can I alter myself? I wasborn like that.' In the first place you were not born
        'like that,' you have lapsedto that. And in the second place your brain is not yourself. It is only a part
        ofyourself, and not the highest seat of authority. Do you love your mother, wife,or children with your brain? Do
        you desire with your brain? Do you, in aword, ultimately and essentially live with your brain? No. Your brain is
        aninstrument. The proof that it is an instrument lies in the fact that, whenextreme necessity urges, you can
        command your brain to do certain things,and it does them. The first of the two great principles which underlie
        theefficiency of the human machine is this: The brain is a servant, exterior to thecentral force of the Ego. If it
        is out of control the reason is not that it isuncontrollable, but merely that its discipline has been neglected.
        The brain canbe trained, as the hand and eye can be trained; it can be made as obedient as asporting dog, and by
        similar methods. In the meantime the indispensablepreparation for brain discipline is to form the habit of
        regarding one's brain asan instrument exterior to one's self, like a tongue or a foot.</p>

      <h6 style="margin-bottom: 5%;">IV</h6>
      <h6 style="margin-bottom: 10%;">THE FIRST PRACTICAL STEP</h6>
      <p>The brain is a highly quaint organism. Let me say at once, lest I should becannonaded by physiologists,
        psychologists, or metaphysicians, that by the'brain' I mean the faculty which reasons and which gives orders to
        the muscles.I mean exactly what the plain man means by the brain. The brain is thediplomatist which arranges
        relations between our instinctive self and theuniverse, and it fulfils its mission when it provides for the
        maximum offreedom to the instincts with the minimum of friction. It argues with theinstincts. It takes them on one
        side and points out the unwisdom of certainperformances. It catches them by the coat-tails when they are about to
        makefools of themselves. 'Don't drink all that iced champagne at a draught,' it saysto one instinct; 'we may die
        of it.' 'Don't catch that rude fellow one in the eye,'it says to another instinct; 'he is more powerful than us.'
        It is, in fact, a majesticspectacle of common sense. And yet it has the most extraordinary lapses. It isjust like
        that man—we all know him and consult him—who is a continualfount of excellent, sagacious advice on everything, but
        who somehow cannotbring his sagacity to bear on his own personal career.In the matter of its own special
        activities the brain is usually undisciplined andunreliable. We never know what it will do next. We give it some
        work to do,say, as we are walking along the street to the office. Perhaps it has to devisesome scheme for making
        £150 suffice for £200, or perhaps it has to plan outthe heads of a very important letter. We meet a pretty woman,
        and away thatundisciplined, sagacious brain runs after her, dropping the scheme or the draftletter, and amusing
        itself with aspirations or regrets for half an hour, an hour,sometimes a day. The serious part of our instinctive
        self feebly remonstrates,but without effect. Or it may be that we have suffered a great disappointment,which is
        definite and hopeless. Will the brain, like a sensible creature, leavethat disappointment alone, and instead of
        living in the past live in the presentor the future? Not it! Though it knows perfectly well that it is wasting its
        timeand casting a very painful and utterly unnecessary gloom over itself and us, itcan so little control its
        unhealthy morbid appetite that no expostulations willinduce it to behave rationally. Or perhaps, after a
        confabulation with the soul,it has been decided that when next a certain harmful instinct comes into playthe brain
        shall firmly interfere. 'Yes,' says the brain, 'I really will watch that.'But when the moment arrives, is the
        brain on the spot? The brain has probablyforgotten the affair entirely, or remembered it too late; or sighs, as
        thevictorious instinct knocks it on the head: 'Well, next time!'All this, and much more that every reader can
        supply from his own excitingsouvenirs, is absurd and ridiculous on the part of the brain. It is a conclusiveproof
        that the brain is out of condition, idle as a nigger, capricious as an actor-manager, and eaten to the core with
        loose habits. Therefore the brain must beput into training. It is the most important part of the human machine by
        whichthe soul expresses and develops itself, and it must learn good habits. Andprimarily it must be taught
        obedience. Obedience can only be taught byimposing one's will, by the sheer force of volition. And the brain must
        bemastered by will-power. The beginning of wise living lies in the control of thebrain by the will; so that the
        brain may act according to the precepts which thebrain itself gives. With an obedient disciplined brain a man may
        live alwaysright up to the standard of his best moments.To teach a child obedience you tell it to do something,
        and you see that thatsomething is done. The same with the brain. Here is the foundation of anefficient life and
        the antidote for the tendency to make a fool of oneself. It ismarvellously simple. Say to your brain: 'From 9
        o'clock to 9.30 this morningyou must dwell without ceasing on a particular topic which I will give you.'Now, it
        doesn't matter what this topic is—the point is to control and invigoratethe brain by exercise—but you may just as
        well give it a useful topic to thinkover as a futile one. You might give it this: 'My brain is my servant. I am
        notthe play-thing of my brain.' Let it concentrate on these statements for thirtyminutes. 'What?' you cry. 'Is
        this the way to an efficient life? Why, there'snothing in it!' Simple as it may appear, this is the way, and it is
        the only way.As for there being nothing in it, try it. I guarantee that you will fail to keepyour brain
        concentrated on the given idea for thirty seconds—let alone thirtyminutes. You will find your brain conducting
        itself in a manner which wouldbe comic were it not tragic. Your first experiments will result in
        dishearteningfailure, for to exact from the brain, at will and by will, concentration on agiven idea for even so
        short a period as half an hour is an exceedingly difficultfeat—and a fatiguing! It needs perseverance. It needs a
        terrible obstinacy onthe part of the will. That brain of yours will be hopping about all over theplace, and every
        time it hops you must bring it back by force to its originalposition. You must absolutely compel it to ignore
        every idea except the onewhich you have selected for its attention. You cannot hope to triumph all atonce. But you
        can hope to triumph. There is no royal road to the control of thebrain. There is no patent dodge about it, and no
        complicated function which aplain person may not comprehend. It is simply a question of: 'I will, I will, andI
        will.' (Italics here are indispensable.)Let me resume. Efficient living, living up to one's best standard, getting
        thelast ounce of power out of the machine with the minimum of friction: thesethings depend on the disciplined and
        vigorous condition of the brain. Thebrain can be disciplined by learning the habit of obedience. And it can
        learnthe habit of obedience by the practice of concentration. Disciplinaryconcentration, though nothing could have
        the air of being simpler, is the basisof the whole structure. This fact must be grasped imaginatively; it must
        beseen and felt. The more regularly concentration is practised, the more firmlywill the imagination grasp the
        effects of it, both direct and indirect. After but afew days of honest trying in the exercise which I have
        indicated, you willperceive its influence. You will grow accustomed to the idea, at first strange inits novelty,
        of the brain being external to the supreme force which is you, andin subjection to that force. You will, as a not
        very distant possibility, seeyourself in possession of the power to switch your brain on and off in aparticular
        subject as you switch electricity on and off in a particular room. Thebrain will get used to the straight paths of
        obedience. And—a remarkablephenomenon—it will, by the mere practice of obedience, become lessforgetful and more
        effective. It will not so frequently give way to an instinctthat takes it by surprise. In a word, it will have
        received a general tonic. With abrain that is improving every day you can set about the perfecting of themachine
        in a scientific manner.</p>

      <h6 style="margin-bottom: 10%;">HABIT-FORMING BY CONCENTRATION</h6>
      <p>As soon as the will has got the upper hand of the brain—as soon as it can sayto the brain, with a fair certainty
        of being obeyed: 'Do this. Think along theselines, and continue to do so without wandering until I give you leave
        to stop'—then is the time arrived when the perfecting of the human machine may beundertaken in a large and
        comprehensive spirit, as a city council undertakesthe purification and reconstruction of a city. The tremendous
        possibilities of anobedient brain will be perceived immediately we begin to reflect upon whatwe mean by our
        'character.' Now, a person's character is, and can be, nothingelse but the total result of his habits of thought.
        A person is benevolentbecause he habitually thinks benevolently. A person is idle because histhoughts dwell
        habitually on the instant pleasures of idleness. It is true thateverybody is born with certain predispositions,
        and that these predispositionsinfluence very strongly the early formation of habits of thought. But the
        factremains that the character is built by long-continued habits of thought. If themature edifice of character
        usually shows in an exaggerated form thepeculiarities of the original predisposition, this merely indicates a
        probabilitythat the slow erection of the edifice has proceeded at haphazard, and thatreason has not presided over
        it. A child may be born with a tendency to bentshoulders. If nothing is done, if on the contrary he becomes a
        clerk and abhorsgymnastics, his shoulders will develop an excessive roundness, entirelythrough habit. Whereas, if
        his will, guided by his reason, had compelled theformation of a corrective physical habit, his shoulders might
        have been, if notquite straight, nearly so. Thus a physical habit! The same with a mental habit.The more closely
        we examine the development of original predispositions, themore clearly we shall see that this development is not
        inevitable, is not aprocess which works itself out independently according to mysterious, ruthlesslaws which we
        cannot understand. For instance, the effect of an originalpredisposition may be destroyed by an accidental shock.
        A young man with aninherited tendency to alcohol may develop into a stern teetotaller through theshock caused by
        seeing his drunken father strike his mother; whereas, if hisfather had chanced to be affectionate in drink, the
        son might have ended in thegutter. No ruthless law here! It is notorious, also, that natures are
        sometimescompletely changed in their development by chance momentary contact withnatures stronger than themselves.
        'From that day I resolved—' etc. You knowthe phrase. Often the resolve is not kept; but often it is kept. A spark
        hasinflamed the will. The burning will has tyrannised over the brain. New habitshave been formed. And the result
        looks just like a miracle.Now, if these great transformations can be brought about by accident, cannotsimilar
        transformations be brought about by a reasonable design? At any rate,if one starts to bring them about, one starts
        with the assurance thattransformations are not impossible, since they have occurred. One starts alsoin the full
        knowledge of the influence of habit on life. Take any one of yourown habits, mental or physical. You will be able
        to recall the time when thathabit did not exist, or if it did exist it was scarcely perceptible. And you
        willdiscover that nearly all your habits have been formed unconsciously, by dailyrepetitions which bore no
        relation to a general plan, and which you practisednot noticing. You will be compelled to admit that your
        'character,' as it is to-day, is a structure that has been built almost without the aid of an
        architect;higgledy-piggledy, anyhow. But occasionally the architect did step in anddesign something. Here and
        there among your habits you will find one thatyou consciously and of deliberate purpose initiated and persevered
        with—doubtless owing to some happy influence. What is the difference between thatconscious habit and the
        unconscious habits? None whatever as regards itseffect on the sum of your character. It may be the strongest of
        all your habits.The only quality that differentiates it from the others is that it has a definiteobject (most
        likely a good object), and that it wholly or partially fulfils thatobject. There is not a man who reads these
        lines but has, in this detail or that,proved in himself that the will, forcing the brain to repeat the same
        actionagain and again, can modify the shape of his character as a sculptor modifiesthe shape of damp clay.But if a
        grown man's character is developing from day to day (as it is), if nine-tenths of the development is due to
        unconscious action and one-tenth toconscious action, and if the one-tenth conscious is the most satisfactory part
        ofthe total result; why, in the name of common sense, henceforward, should notnine-tenths, instead of one-tenth,
        be due to conscious action? What is there toprevent this agreeable consummation? There is nothing whatever to
        prevent it—except insubordination on the part of the brain. And insubordination of thebrain can be cured, as I
        have previously shown. When I see men unhappy andinefficient in the craft of living, from sheer, crass inattention
        to their owndevelopment; when I see misshapen men building up businesses and empires,and never stopping to build
        up themselves; when I see dreary men expendingprecisely the same energy on teaching a dog to walk on its hind-legs
        as wouldbrighten the whole colour of their own lives, I feel as if I wanted to give up theghost, so ridiculous, so
        fatuous does the spectacle seem! But, of course, I donot give up the ghost. The paroxysm passes. Only I really
        must cry out: 'Can'tyou see what you're missing? Can't you see that you're missing the mostinteresting thing on
        earth, far more interesting than businesses, empires, anddogs? Doesn't it strike you how clumsy and short-sighted
        you are—workingalways with an inferior machine when you might have a smooth-glidingperfection? Doesn't it strike
        you how badly you are treating yourself?'Listen, you confirmed grumbler, you who make the evening meal hideous
        withcomplaints against destiny—for it is you I will single out. Are you aware whatpeople are saying about you
        behind your back? They are saying that yourender yourself and your family miserable by the habit which has grown
        onyou of always grumbling. 'Surely it isn't as bad as that?' you protest. Yes, it isjust as bad as that. You say:
        'The fact is, I know it's absurd to grumble. But I'mlike that. I've tried to stop it, and I can't!' How have you
        tried to stop it? 'Well,I've made up my mind several times to fight against it, but I never succeed.This is
        strictly between ourselves. I don't usually admit that I'm a grumbler.'Considering that you grumble for about an
        hour and a half every day of yourlife, it was sanguine, my dear sir, to expect to cure such a habit by means of
        asolitary intention, formed at intervals in the brain and then forgotten. No! Youmust do more than that. If you
        will daily fix your brain firmly for half an houron the truth (you know it to be a truth) that grumbling is absurd
        and futile,your brain will henceforward begin to form a habit in that direction; it willbegin to be moulded to the
        idea that grumbling is absurd and futile. In oddmoments, when it isn't thinking of anything in particular, it will
        suddenlyremember that grumbling is absurd and futile. When you sit down to the mealand open your mouth to say: 'I
        can't think what my ass of a partner means by—' it will remember that grumbling is absurd and futile, and will
        alter thearrangement of your throat, teeth, and tongue, so that you will say: 'What fineweather we're having!' In
        brief, it will remember involuntarily, by a new habit.All who look into their experience will admit that the
        failure to replace oldhabits by new ones is due to the fact that at the critical moment the brain doesnot
        remember; it simply forgets. The practice of concentration will cure that.All depends on regular concentration.
        This grumbling is an instance, thoughchosen not quite at hazard.</p>

      <h6 style="margin-bottom: 10%;">LORD OVER THE NODDLE</h6>
      <p>Having proved by personal experiment the truth of the first of the two greatprinciples which concern the human
        machine—namely, that the brain is aservant, not a master, and can be controlled—we may now come to thesecond. The
        second is more fundamental than the first, but it can be of no useuntil the first is understood and put into
        practice. The human machine is anapparatus of brain and muscle for enabling the Ego to develop freely in
        theuniverse by which it is surrounded, without friction. Its function is to convertthe facts of the universe to
        the best advantage of the Ego. The facts of theuniverse are the material with which it is its business to deal—not
        the facts ofan ideal universe, but the facts of this universe. Hence, when friction occurs,when the facts of the
        universe cease to be of advantage to the Ego, the fault isin the machine. It is not the solar system that has gone
        wrong, but the humanmachine. Second great principle, therefore: 'In case of friction, the machine isalways at
        fault.'You can control nothing but your own mind. Even your two-year-old babemay defy you by the instinctive force
        of its personality. But your own mindyou can control. Your own mind is a sacred enclosure into which
        nothingharmful can enter except by your permission. Your own mind has the power totransmute every external
        phenomenon to its own purposes. If happiness arisesfrom cheerfulness, kindliness, and rectitude (and who will deny
        it?), whatpossible combination of circumstances is going to make you unhappy so longas the machine remains in
        order? If self-development consists in the utilisationof one's environment (not utilisation of somebody else's
        environment), howcan your environment prevent you from developing? You would look ratherfoolish without it,
        anyway. In that noddle of yours is everything necessary fordevelopment, for the maintaining of dignity, for the
        achieving of happiness,and you are absolute lord over the noddle, will you but exercise the powers oflordship. Why
        worry about the contents of somebody else's noddle, in whichyou can be nothing but an intruder, when you may
        arrive at a better result,with absolute certainty, by confining your activities to your own? 'Lookwithin.' 'The
        Kingdom of Heaven is within you.' 'Oh, yes!' you protest. 'Allthat's old. Epictetus said that. Marcus Aurelius
        said that. Christ said that.' Theydid. I admit it readily. But if you were ruffled this morning because
        yourmotor-omnibus broke down, and you had to take a cab, then so far as you areconcerned these great teachers
        lived in vain. You, calling yourself a reasonableman, are going about dependent for your happiness, dignity, and
        growth, upona thousand things over which you have no control, and the most exquisitelyorganised machine for
        ensuring happiness, dignity, and growth, is rustingaway inside you. And all because you have a sort of notion that
        a saying saidtwo thousand years ago cannot be practical.You remark sagely to your child: 'No, my child, you cannot
        have that moon,and you will accomplish nothing by crying for it. Now, here is this beautifulbox of bricks, by
        means of which you may amuse yourself while learningmany wonderful matters and improving your mind. You must try
        to be contentwith what you have, and to make the best of it. If you had the moon youwouldn't be any happier.' Then
        you lie awake half the night repining becausethe last post has brought a letter to the effect that 'the Board
        cannot entertainyour application for,' etc. You say the two cases are not alike. They are not.Your child has never
        heard of Epictetus. On the other hand, justice is themoon. At your age you surely know that. 'But the Directors
        ought to havegranted my application,' you insist. Exactly! I agree. But we are not in auniverse of oughts. You
        have a special apparatus within you for dealing with auniverse where oughts are flagrantly disregarded. And you
        are not using it.You are lying awake, keeping your wife awake, injuring your health, injuringhers, losing your
        dignity and your cheerfulness. Why? Because you think thatthese antics and performances will influence the Board?
        Because you thinkthat they will put you into a better condition for dealing with yourenvironment to-morrow? Not a
        bit. Simply because the machine is at fault.In certain cases we do make use of our machines (as well as their
        sadcondition of neglect will allow), but in other cases we behave in anextraordinarily irrational manner. Thus if
        we sally out and get caught in aheavy shower we do not, unless very far gone in foolishness, sit down andcurse the
        weather. We put up our umbrella, if we have one, and if not we hurryhome. We may grumble, but it is not serious
        grumbling; we accept the showeras a fact of the universe, and control ourselves. Thus also, if by a
        suddencatastrophe we lose somebody who is important to us, we grieve, but wecontrol ourselves, recognising one of
        those hazards of destiny from which noteven millionaires are exempt. And the result on our Ego is usually to
        improveit in essential respects. But there are other strokes of destiny, other facts of theuniverse, against which
        we protest as a child protests when deprived of themoon.Take the case of an individual with an imperfect idea of
        honesty. Now, thatindividual is the consequence of his father and mother and his environment,and his father and
        mother of theirs, and so backwards to the single-celledprotoplasm. That individual is a result of the cosmic
        order, the inevitableproduct of cause and effect. We know that. We must admit that he is just asmuch a fact of the
        universe as a shower of rain or a storm at sea that swallowsa ship. We freely grant in the abstract that there
        must be, at the present stage ofevolution, a certain number of persons with unfair minds. We are quite readyto
        contemplate such an individual with philosophy—until it happens that, inthe course of the progress of the solar
        system, he runs up against ourselves.Then listen to the outcry! Listen to the continual explosions of a righteous
        managgrieved! The individual may be our clerk, cashier, son, father, brother,partner, wife, employer. We are
        ill-used! We are being treated unfairly! Wekick; we scream. We nourish the inward sense of grievance that eats the
        coreout of content. We sit down in the rain. We decline to think of umbrellas, or torun to shelter.We care not
        that that individual is a fact which the universe has been slowlymanufacturing for millions of years. Our attitude
        implies that we want eternityto roll back and begin again, in such wise that we at any rate shall not bedisturbed.
        Though we have a machine for the transmutation of facts into foodfor our growth, we do not dream of using it. But,
        we say, he is doing us harm!Where? In our minds. He has robbed us of our peace, our comfort, ourhappiness, our
        good temper. Even if he has, we might just as well inveighagainst a shower. But has he? What was our brain doing
        while this naughtyperson stepped in and robbed us of the only possessions worth having? No,no! It is not that he
        has done us harm—the one cheerful item in a universe ofstony facts is that no one can harm anybody except
        himself—it is merely thatwe have been silly, precisely as silly as if we had taken a seat in the rain with afolded
        umbrella by our sideThe machine is at fault. I fancy we are nowobtaining glimpses of what that phrase really
        means.</p>

      <h6 style="margin-bottom: 10%;">WHAT 'LIVING' CHIEFLY IS</h6>
      <p>It is in intercourse—social, sentimental, or business—with one's fellows thatthe qualities and the condition of
        the human machine are put to the test andstrained. That part of my life which I conduct by myself, without
        reference—or at any rate without direct reference—to others, I can usually manage in sucha way that the gods do
        not positively weep at the spectacle thereof. Myenvironment is simpler, less puzzling, when I am alone, my calm
        and my self-control less liable to violent fluctuations. Impossible to be disturbed by achair! Impossible that a
        chair should get on one's nerves! Impossible to blamea chair for not being as reasonable, as archangelic as I am
        myself! But when itcomes to people!... Well, that is 'living,' then! The art of life, the art ofextracting all its
        power from the human machine, does not lie chiefly inprocesses of bookish-culture, nor in contemplations of the
        beauty and majestyof existence. It lies chiefly in keeping the peace, the whole peace, and nothingbut the peace,
        with those with whom one is 'thrown.' Is it in sitting ecstaticover Shelley, Shakespeare, or Herbert Spencer,
        solitary in my room of a night,that I am 'improving myself' and learning to live? Or is it in watching over allmy
        daily human contacts? Do not seek to escape the comparison byinsinuating that I despise study, or by pointing out
        that the eternal verities arebeyond dailiness. Nothing of the kind! I am so 'silly' about books that merelyto
        possess them gives me pleasure. And if the verities are good for eternitythey ought to be good for a day. If I
        cannot exchange them for daily coin—if Ican't buy happiness for a single day because I've nothing less than an
        eternalverity about me and nobody has sufficient change—then my eternal verity isnot an eternal verity. It is
        merely an unnegotiable bit of glass(called adiamond), or even a note on the Bank of Engraving.I can say to myself
        when I arise in the morning: 'I am master of my brain. Noone can get in there and rage about like a bull in a
        china shop. If mycompanions on the planet's crust choose to rage about they cannot affect me! Iwill not let them.
        I have power to maintain my own calm, and I will. Noearthly being can force me to be false to my principles, or to
        be blind to thebeauty of the universe, or to be gloomy, or to be irritable, or to complainagainst my lot. For
        these things depend on the brain; cheerfulness, kindliness,and honest thinking are all within the department of
        the brain. The disciplinedbrain can accomplish them. And my brain is disciplined, and I will disciplineit more and
        more as the days pass. I am, therefore, independent of hazard, andI will back myself to conduct all intercourse as
        becomes a rational creature.' ...I can say this. I can ram this argument by force of will into my brain, and
        bydint of repeating it often enough I shall assuredly arrive at the supreme virtuesof reason. I should assuredly
        conquer—the brain being such a machine ofhabit—even if I did not take the trouble to consider in the slightest
        degreewhat manner of things my fellow-men are—by acting merely in my owninterests. But the way of perfection (I
        speak relatively) will be immenselyshortened and smoothed if I do consider, dispassionately, the case of the
        otherhuman machines. Thus:—The truth is that my attitude towards my fellows is fundamentally and totallywrong, and
        that it entails on my thinking machine a strain which is quiteunnecessary, though I may have arranged the machine
        so as to withstand thestrain successfully. The secret of smooth living is a calm cheerfulness whichwill leave me
        always in full possession of my reasoning faculty—in order thatI may live by reason instead of by instinct and
        momentary passion. The secretof calm cheerfulness is kindliness; no person can be consistently cheerful andcalm
        who does not consistently think kind thoughts. But how can I be kindlywhen I pass the major portion of my time in
        blaming the people who surroundme—who are part of my environment? If I, blaming, achieve some approachto
        kindliness, it is only by a great and exhausting effort of self-mastery. Theinmost secret, then, lies in not
        blaming, in not judging and emitting verdicts.Oh! I do not blame by word of mouth! I am far too advanced for such
        apuerility. I keep the blame in my own breast, where it festers. I am alwaysprivately forgiving, which is bad for
        me. Because, you know, there is nothingto forgive. I do not have to forgive bad weather; nor, if I found myself in
        anearthquake, should I have to forgive the earthquake.All blame, uttered or unexpressed, is wrong. I do not blame
        myself. I canexplain myself to myself. I can invariably explain myself. If I forged a friend'sname on a cheque I
        should explain the affair quite satisfactorily to myself.And instead of blaming myself I should sympathise with
        myself for havingbeen driven into such an excessively awkward corner. Let me examinehonestly my mental processes,
        and I must admit that my attitude towardsothers is entirely different from my attitude towards myself. I must
        admit thatin the seclusion of my mind, though I say not a word, I am constantly blamingothers because I am not
        happy. Whenever I bump up against an opposingpersonality and my smooth progress is impeded, I secretly blame the
        opposer.I act as though I had shouted to the world: 'Clear out of the way, every one, forI am coming!' Every one
        does not clear out of the way. I did not really expectevery one to clear out of the way. But I act, within, as
        though I had soexpected. I blame. Hence kindliness, hence cheerfulness, is rendered vastlymore difficult for
        me.What I ought to do is this! I ought to reflect again and again, and yet again,that the beings among whom I have
        to steer, the living environment out ofwhich I have to manufacture my happiness, are just as inevitable in the
        schemeof evolution as I am myself; have just as much right to be themselves as I haveto be myself; are precisely
        my equals in the face of Nature; are capable ofbeing explained as I am capable of being explained; are entitled to
        the samelatitude as I am entitled to, and are no more responsible for their compositionand their environment than
        I for mine. I ought to reflect again and again, andyet again, that they all deserve from me as much sympathy as I
        give to myself.Why not? Having thus reflected in a general manner, I ought to take one byone the individuals with
        whom I am brought into frequent contact, and seek,by a deliberate effort of the imagination and the reason, to
        understand them, tounderstand why they act thus and thus, what their difficulties are, what their'explanation' is,
        and how friction can be avoided. So I ought to reflect,morning after morning, until my brain is saturated with the
        cases of theseindividuals. Here is a course of discipline. If I follow it I shall gradually losethe preposterous
        habit of blaming, and I shall have laid the foundations of thatquiet, unshakable self-possession which is the
        indispensable preliminary ofconduct according to reason, of thorough efficiency in the machine ofhappiness. But
        something in me, something distinctly base, says: 'Yes. Theput-yourself-in-his-place business over again! The
        do-unto-others businessover again!' Just so! Something in me is ashamed of being 'moral.' (You allknow the
        feeling!) Well, morals are naught but another name for reasonableconduct; a higher and more practical form of
        egotism—an egotism which,while freeing others, frees myself. I have tried the lower form of egotism. Andit has
        failed. If I am afraid of being moral, if I prefer to cut off my nose to spitemy face, well, I must accept the
        consequences. But truth will prevail.</p>

      <h6 style="margin-bottom: 10%;">THE DAILY FRICTION</h6>
      <p>It is with common daily affairs that I am now dealing, not with heroicenterprises, ambitions, martyrdoms. Take
        the day, the ordinary day in theordinary house or office. Though it comes seven times a week, and is the mostbanal
        thing imaginable, it is quite worth attention. How does the machine getthrough it? Ah! the best that can be said
        of the machine is that it does getthrough it, somehow. The friction, though seldom such as to bring matters to
        astandstill, is frequent—the sort of friction that, when it occurs in a bicycle, isjust sufficient to annoy the
        rider, but not sufficient to make him get off themachine and examine the bearings. Occasionally the friction is
        very loud;indeed, disturbing, and at rarer intervals it shrieks, like an omnibus brake outof order. You know those
        days when you have the sensation that life is notlarge enough to contain the household or the office-staff, when
        the business ofintercourse may be compared to the manoeuvres of two people who, havingawakened with a bad
        headache, are obliged to dress simultaneously in a verysmall bedroom. 'After you with that towel!' in accents of
        bitter, grindingpoliteness. 'If you could kindly move your things off this chair!' in a voice thatwould blow
        brains out if it were a bullet. I venture to say that you know thosedays. 'But,' you reply, 'such days are few.
        Usually...!' Well, usually, the friction,though less intense, is still proceeding. We grow accustomed to it. We
        scarcelynotice it, as a person in a stuffy chamber will scarcely notice the stuffiness.But the deteriorating
        influence due to friction goes on, even if unperceived.And one morning we perceive its ravages—and write a letter
        to the Telegraphto inquire whether life is worth living, or whether marriage is a failure, orwhether men are more
        polite than women. The proof that friction, in variousand varying degrees, is practically conscious in most
        households lies in thefact that when we chance on a household where there is no friction we arestartled. We can't
        recover from the phenomenon. And in describing thishousehold to our friends, we say: 'They get on so well
        together,' as if we weresaying: 'They have wings and can fly! Just fancy! Did you ever hear of such athing?'Ninety
        per cent. of all daily friction is caused by tone—mere tone of voice.Try this experiment. Say: 'Oh, you little
        darling, you sweet pet, you entirelycharming creature!' to a baby or a dog; but roar these delightful epithets in
        thetone of saying: 'You infernal little nuisance! If I hear another sound I'll breakevery bone in your body!' The
        baby will infallibly whimper, and the dog willinfallibly mouch off. True, a dog is not a human being, neither is a
        baby. Theycannot understand. It is precisely because they cannot understand andarticulate words that the
        experiment is valuable; for it separates the effect ofthe tone from the effect of the word spoken. He who speaks,
        speaks twice. Hiswords convey his thought, and his tone conveys his mental attitude towardsthe person spoken to.
        And certainly the attitude, so far as friction goes, is moreimportant than the thought. Your wife may say to you:
        'I shall buy that hat Ispoke to you about.' And you may reply, quite sincerely, 'As you please.' But itwill depend
        on your tone whether you convey: 'As you please. I amsympathetically anxious that your innocent caprices should be
        indulged.' Orwhether you convey: 'As you please. Only don't bother me with hats. I amabove hats. A great deal too
        much money is spent in this house on hats.However, I'm helpless!' Or whether you convey: 'As you please, heart of
        myheart, but if you would like to be a nice girl, go gently. We're rather tight.' Ineed not elaborate. I am sure
        of being comprehended.As tone is the expression of attitude, it is, of course, caused by attitude. Thefrictional
        tone is chiefly due to that general attitude of blame which I havealready condemned as being absurd and
        unjustifiable. As, by constantwatchful discipline, we gradually lose this silly attitude of blame, so the tonewill
        of itself gradually change. But the two ameliorations can proceedtogether, and it is a curious thing that an
        agreeable tone, artificially anddeliberately adopted, will influence the mental attitude almost as much as
        themental attitude will influence the tone. If you honestly feel resentful againstsome one, but, having understood
        the foolishness of fury, intentionally maskyour fury under a persuasive tone, your fury will at once begin to
        abate. Youwill be led into a rational train of thought; you will see that after all the objectof your resentment
        has a right to exist, and that he is neither a doormat nor ascoundrel, and that anyhow nothing is to be gained,
        and much is to be lost, byfury. You will see that fury is unworthy of you.Do you remember the gentleness of the
        tone which you employed after thehealing of your first quarrel with a beloved companion? Do you remember
        thepersuasive tone which you used when you wanted to obtain something from adifficult person on whom your
        happiness depended? Why should not yourtone always combine these qualities? Why should you not carefully
        schoolyour tone? Is it beneath you to ensure the largest possible amount of your own'way' by the simplest means?
        Or is there at the back of your mind thatpeculiarly English and German idea that politeness, sympathy, and respect
        foranother immortal soul would imply deplorable weakness on your part? Yousay that your happiness does not depend
        on every person whom you happen tospeak to. Yes, it does. Your happiness is always dependent on just that
        person.Produce friction, and you suffer. Idle to argue that the person has no businessto be upset by your tone!
        You have caused avoidable friction, simply becauseyour machine for dealing with your environment was suffering
        from pride,ignorance, or thoughtlessness. You say I am making a mountain out of a mole-hill. No! I am making a
        mountain out of ten million mole-hills. And that iswhat life does. It is the little but continuous causes that
        have great effects. Irepeat: Why not deliberately adopt a gentle, persuasive tone—just to see whatthe results are?
        Surely you are not ashamed to be wise. You may smilesuperiorly as you read this. Yet you know very well that more
        than once youhave resolved to use a gentle and persuasive tone on all occasions, and that thesole reason why you
        had that fearful shindy yesterday with your cousin'ssister-in-law was that you had long since failed to keep your
        resolve. But youwere of my mind once, and more than once.What you have to do is to teach the new habit to your
        brain by dailyconcentration on it; by forcing your brain to think of nothing else for half anhour of a morning.
        After a time the brain will begin to rememberautomatically. For, of course, the explanation of your previous
        failures is thatyour brain, undisciplined, merely forgot at the critical moment. The tone wasout of your mouth
        before your brain had waked up. It is necessary to watch, asthough you were a sentinel, not only against the wrong
        tone, but against theother symptoms of the attitude of blame. Such as the frown. It is necessary toregard yourself
        constantly, and in minute detail. You lie in bed for half an hourand enthusiastically concentrate on this
        beautiful new scheme of the right tone.You rise, and because you don't achieve a proper elegance of necktie at
        thefirst knotting, you frown and swear and clench your teeth! There is a symptomof the wrong attitude towards your
        environment. You are awake, but yourbrain isn't. It is in such a symptom that you may judge yourself. And not
        atrifling symptom either! If you will frown at a necktie, if you will uselanguage to a necktie which no gentleman
        should use to a necktie, what willyou be capable of to a responsible being?... Yes, it is very difficult. But it
        canbe done.</p>

      <h6 style="margin-bottom: 10%;">'FIRE!'</h6>
      <p>In this business of daily living, of ordinary usage of the machine in hourlyintercourse, there occurs sometimes a
        phenomenon which is the cause of agreat deal of trouble, and the result of a very ill-tended machine. It is
        aphenomenon impossible to ignore, and yet, so shameful is it, so degrading, soshocking, so miserable, that I
        hesitate to mention it. For one class of reader iscertain to ridicule me, loftily saying: 'One really doesn't
        expect to find this sortof thing in print nowadays!' And another class of reader is certain to get
        angry.Nevertheless, as one of my main objects in the present book is to discussmatters which 'people don't talk
        about,' I shall discuss this matter. But mydiffidence in doing so is such that I must approach it deviously,
        describing itfirst by means of a figure.Imagine that, looking at a man's house, you suddenly perceive it to be on
        fire.The flame is scarcely perceptible. You could put it out if you had a free hand.But you have not got a free
        hand. It is his house, not yours. He may or may notknow that his house is burning. You are aware, by experience,
        however, that ifyou directed his attention to the flame, the effect of your warning would beexceedingly singular,
        almost incredible. For the effect would be that he wouldinstantly begin to strike matches, pour on petroleum, and
        fan the flame,violently resenting interference. Therefore you can only stand and watch,hoping that he will notice
        the flames before they are beyond control, andextinguish them. The probability is, however, that he will notice
        the flames toolate. And powerless to avert disaster, you are condemned, therefore, to watchthe damage of valuable
        property. The flames leap higher and higher, and theydo not die down till they have burned themselves out. You
        avert your gazefrom the spectacle, and until you are gone the owner of the house pretends thatnothing has
        occurred. When alone he curses himself for his carelessness.The foregoing is meant to be a description of what
        happens when a man passesthrough the incendiary experience known as 'losing his temper.' (There! the catof my
        chapter is out of the bag!) A man who has lost his temper is simplybeing 'burnt out.' His constitutes one of the
        most curious and (for everybody)humiliating spectacles that life offers. It is an insurrection, a boiling over,
        asweeping storm. Dignity, common sense, justice are shrivelled up anddestroyed. Anarchy reigns. The devil has
        broken his chain. Instinct is stampingon the face of reason. And in that man civilisation has temporarily
        recededmillions of years. Of course, the thing amounts to a nervous disease, and Ithink it is almost universal.
        You at once protest that you never lose yourtemper—haven't lost your temper for ages! But do you not mean that you
        havenot smashed furniture for ages? These fires are of varying intensities. Some ofthem burn very dully. Yet they
        burn. One man loses his temper; another ismerely 'ruffled.' But the event is the same in kind. When you are
        'ruffled,'when you are conscious of a resentful vibration that surprises all your being,when your voice changes,
        when you notice a change in the demeanour of yourcompanion, who sees that he has 'touched a tender point,' you may
        not go tothe length of smashing furniture, but you have had a fire, and your dignity isdamaged. You admit it to
        yourself afterwards. I am sure you know what Imean. And I am nearly sure that you, with your courageous candour,
        willadmit that from time to time you suffer from these mysterious 'fires.''Temper,' one of the plagues of human
        society, is generally held to beincurable, save by the vague process of exercising self-control—a processwhich
        seldom has any beneficial results. It is regarded now as smallpox usedto be regarded—as a visitation of
        Providence, which must be borne. But I donot hold it to be incurable. I am convinced that it is permanently
        curable. Andits eminent importance as a nuisance to mankind at large deserves, I think, thatit should receive
        particular attention. Anyhow, I am strongly against thevisitation of Providence theory, as being unscientific,
        primitive, and conduciveto unashamed laissez-aller. A man can be master in his own house. If hecannot be master by
        simple force of will, he can be master by ruse and wile. Iwould employ cleverness to maintain the throne of reason
        when it is likely tobe upset in the mind by one of these devastating and disgraceful insurrectionsof brute
        instinct.It is useless for a man in the habit of losing or mislaying his temper to arguewith himself that such a
        proceeding is folly, that it serves no end, and doesnothing but harm. It is useless for him to argue that in
        allowing his temper tostray he is probably guilty of cruelty, and certainly guilty of injustice to thosepersons
        who are forced to witness the loss. It is useless for him to argue that aman of uncertain temper in a house is
        like a man who goes about a house witha loaded revolver sticking from his pocket, and that all considerations
        offairness and reason have to be subordinated in that house to the fear of therevolver, and that such peace as is
        maintained in that house is often a shamefuland an unjust peace. These arguments will not be strong enough to
        prevailagainst one of the most powerful and capricious of all habits. This habit mustbe met and conquered (and it
        canbe!) by an even more powerful quality in thehuman mind; I mean the universal human horror of looking
        ridiculous. Theman who loses his temper often thinks he is doing something rather fine andmajestic. On the
        contrary, so far is this from being the fact, he is merelymaking an ass of himself. He is merely parading himself
        as an undignifiedfool, as that supremely contemptible figure—a grown-up baby. He mayintimidate a feeble companion
        by his raging, or by the dark sullenness of amore subdued flame, but in the heart of even the weakest companion is
        abedrock feeling of contempt for him. The way in which a man of uncertaintemper is treated by his friends proves
        that they despise him, for they do nottreat him as a reasonable being. How should they treat him as a
        reasonablebeing when the tenure of his reason is so insecure? And if only he could hearwhat is said of him behind
        his back!...The invalid can cure himself by teaching his brain the habit of dwelling uponhis extreme fatuity. Let
        him concentrate regularly, with intense fixation, uponthe ideas: 'When I lose my temper, when I get ruffled, when
        that mysteriousvibration runs through me, I am making a donkey of myself, a donkey, and adonkey! You understand, a
        preposterous donkey! I am behaving like a greatbaby. I look a fool. I am a spectacle bereft of dignity. Everybody
        despises me,smiles at me in secret, disdains the idiotic ass with whom it is impossible toreason.'Ordinarily the
        invalid disguises from himself this aspect of his disease, and hisbrain will instinctively avoid it as much as it
        can. But in hours of calm he canslowly and regularly force his brain, by the practice of concentration,
        tofamiliarise itself with just this aspect, so that in time its instinct will be to thinkfirst, and not last, of
        just this aspect. When he has arrived at that point he issaved. No man who, at the very inception of the fire, is
        visited with a clearvision of himself as an arrant ass and pitiable object of contempt, will lack thevolition to
        put the fire out. But, be it noted, he will not succeed until he can doit at once. A fire is a fire, and the
        engines must gallop by themselves out of thestation instantly. This means the acquirement of a mental habit.
        During thepreliminary stages of the cure he should, of course, avoid inflammablesituations. This is a perfectly
        simple thing to do, if the brain has beendisciplined out of its natural forgetfulness.</p>

      <h6 style="margin-bottom: 10%;">MISCHIEVOUSLY OVERWORKING IT</h6>
      <p>I have dealt with the two general major causes of friction in the daily use ofthe machine. I will now deal with a
        minor cause, and make an end of meredailiness. This minor cause—and after all I do not know that its results are
        sotrifling as to justify the epithet 'minor'—is the straining of the machine byforcing it to do work which it was
        never intended to do. Although we areincapable of persuading our machines to do effectively that which they
        arebound to do somehow, we continually overburden them with entirelyunnecessary and inept tasks. We cannot, it
        would seem, let things alone.For example, in the ordinary household the amount of machine horse-powerexpended in
        fighting for the truth is really quite absurd. This pure zeal for theestablishment and general admission of the
        truth is usually termed'contradictoriness.' But, of course, it is not that; it is something higher. Mywife states
        that the Joneses have gone into a new flat, of which the rent is £165a year. Now, Jones has told me personally
        that the rent of his new flat is £156a year. I correct my wife. Knowing that she is in the right, she corrects me.
        Shecannot bear that a falsehood should prevail. It is not a question of £9, it is aquestion of truth. Her
        enthusiasm for truth excites my enthusiasm for truth.Five minutes ago I didn't care twopence whether the rent of
        the Joneses' newflat was £165 or £156 or £1056 a year. But now I care intensely that it is £156.I have formed
        myself into a select society for the propagating of the truthabout the rent of the Joneses' new flat, and my wife
        has done the same. Ineloquence, in argumentative skill, in strict supervision of our tempers, we eachof us
        squander enormous quantities of that h.-p. which is so precious to us.And the net effect is naught.Now, if one of
        us two had understood the elementary principles of humanengineering, that one would have said (privately): 'Truth
        is indestructible.Truth will out. Truth is never in a hurry. If it doesn't come out to-day it willcome out
        to-morrow or next year. It can take care of itself. Ultimately my wife(or my husband) will learn the essential
        cosmic truth about the rent of theJoneses' new flat. I already know it, and the moment when she (or he) knows
        italso will be the moment of my triumph. She (or he) will not celebrate mytriumph openly, but it will be none the
        less real. And my reputation foraccuracy and calm restraint will be consolidated. If, by a rare mischance, I amin
        error, it will be vastly better for me in the day of my undoing that I have notbeen too positive now. Besides,
        nobody has appointed me sole custodian of thegreat truth concerning the rent of the Joneses' new flat. I was not
        brought intothe world to be a safe-deposit, and more urgent matters summon me to effort.'If one of us had
        meditated thus, much needless friction would have beenavoided and power saved; amour-propre would not have been
        exposed torisks; the sacred cause of truth would not in the least have suffered; and therent of the Joneses' new
        flat would anyhow have remained exactly what it is.In addition to straining the machine by our excessive anxiety
        for the spread oftruth, we give a very great deal too much attention to the state of otherpeople's machines. I
        cannot too strongly, too sarcastically, deprecate thisastonishing habit. It will be found to be rife in nearly
        every household and innearly every office. We are most of us endeavouring to rearrange themechanism in other heads
        than our own. This is always dangerous andgenerally futile. Considering the difficulty we have in our own brains,
        whereour efforts are sure of being accepted as well-meant, and where we have at anyrate a rough notion of the
        machine's construction, our intrepidity inadventuring among the delicate adjustments of other brains is
        remarkable. Weare cursed by too much of the missionary spirit. We must needs voyage intothe China of our brother's
        brain, and explain there that things are seriouslywrong in that heathen land, and make ourselves unpleasant in the
        hope ofgetting them put right. We have all our own brain and body on which to wreakour personality, but this is
        not enough; we must extend our personality further,just as though we were a colonising world-power intoxicated by
        the idea of the'white man's burden.'One of the central secrets of efficient daily living is to leave our
        dailycompanions alone a great deal more than we do, and attend to ourselves. If adaily companion is conducting his
        life upon principles which you know to befalse, and with results which you feel to be unpleasant, the safe rule is
        to keepyour mouth shut. Or if, out of your singular conceit, you are compelled toopen it, open it with all
        precautions, and with the formal politeness you woulduse to a stranger. Intimacy is no excuse for rough manners,
        though themajority of us seem to think it is. You are not in charge of the universe; youare in charge of yourself.
        You cannot hope to manage the universe in yourspare time, and if you try you will probably make a mess of such
        part of theuniverse as you touch, while gravely neglecting yourself. In every family thereis generally some one
        whose meddlesome interest in other machines leads toserious friction in his own. Criticise less, even in the
        secrecy of your chamber.And do not blame at all. Accept your environment and adapt yourself to it insilence,
        instead of noisily attempting to adapt your environment to yourself.Here is true wisdom. You have no business
        trespassing beyond the confines ofyour own individuality. In so trespassing you are guilty of impertinence. Thisis
        obvious. And yet one of the chief activities of home-life consists in prancingabout at random on other people's
        private lawns. What I say applies even tothe relation between parents and children. And though my precept
        isexaggerated, it is purposely exaggerated in order effectively to balance theexaggeration in the opposite
        direction.All individualities, other than one's own, are part of one's environment. Theevolutionary process is
        going on all right, and they are a portion of it. Treatthem as inevitable. To assert that they are inevitable is
        not to assert that theyare unalterable. Only the alteration of them is not primarily your affair; it istheirs.
        Your affair is to use them, as they are, without self-righteousness,blame, or complaint, for the smooth
        furtherance of your own ends. There is nointention here to rob them of responsibility by depriving them of
        free-willwhile saddling you with responsibility as a free agent. As your environmentthey must be accepted as
        inevitable, because they are inevitable. But as centresthemselves they have their own responsibility: which is not
        yours. The historicquestion: 'Have we free-will, or are we the puppets of determinism?' entersnow. As a question
        it is fascinating and futile. It has never been, and it neverwill be, settled. The theory of determinism cannot be
        demolished by argument.But in his heart every man, including the most obstinate supporter of thetheory, demolishes
        it every hour of every day. On the other hand, the theory offree-will can be demolished by ratiocination! So much
        the worse forratiocination! If we regard ourselves as free agents, and the personalitiessurrounding us as the
        puppets of determinism, we shall have arrived at theworking compromise from which the finest results of living can
        be obtained.The philosophic experience of centuries, if it has proved anything, has provedthis. And the man who
        acts upon it in the common, banal contracts andcollisions of the difficult experiment which we call daily life,
        will speedilybecome convinced of its practical worth.</p>

      <p>For ten chapters you have stood it, but not without protest. I know the feelingwhich is in your minds, and which
        has manifested itself in numerouscriticisms of my ideas. That feeling may be briefly translated, perhaps,
        thus:'This is all very well, but it isn't true, not a bit! It's only a fairy-tale that youhave been telling us.
        Miracles don't happen,' etc. I, on my part, have a feelingthat unless I take your feeling in hand at once, and
        firmly deal with it, I hadbetter put my shutters up, for you will have got into the way of regarding mesimply as a
        source of idle amusement. Already I can perceive, from theexpressions of some critics, that, so far as they are
        concerned, I might just aswell not have written a word. Therefore at this point I pause, in order to insistonce
        more upon what I began by saying.The burden of your criticism is: 'Human nature is always the same. I know
        myfaults. But it is useless to tell me about them. I can't alter them. I was born likethat.' The fatal weakness of
        this argument is, first, that it is based on acomplete falsity; and second, that it puts you in an untenable
        position. Humannature does change. Nothing can be more unscientific, more hopelesslymediæval, than to imagine that
        it does not. It changes like everything else. Youcan't see it change. True! But then you can't see the grass
        growing—not unlessyou arise very early.Is human nature the same now as in the days of Babylonian civilisation,
        whenthe social machine was oiled by drenchings of blood? Is it the same now as inthe days of Greek civilisation,
        when there was no such thing as romantic lovebetween the sexes? Is it the same now as it was during the centuries
        whenconstant friction had to provide its own cure in the shape of constant war? Is itthe same now as it was on 2nd
        March 1819, when the British Governmentofficially opposed a motion to consider the severity of the criminal
        laws(which included capital punishment for cutting down a tree, and other sensibledodges against friction), and
        were defeated by a majority of only nineteenvotes? Is it the same now as in the year 1883, when the first S.P.C.C.
        wasformed in England?If you consider that human nature is still the same you should instantly go outand make a
        bonfire of the works of Spencer, Darwin, and Wallace, and thenreturn to enjoy the purely jocular side of the
        present volume. If you admit thatit has changed, let me ask you how it has changed, unless by the
        continualinfinitesimal efforts, upon themselves, of individual men, like you and me.Did you suppose it was changed
        by magic, or by Acts of Parliament, or by theaction of groups on persons, and not of persons on groups? Let me
        tell youthat human nature has changed since yesterday. Let me tell you that to-dayreason has a more powerful voice
        in the directing of instinct than it hadyesterday. Let me tell you that to-day the friction of the machines is
        lessscreechy and grinding than it was yesterday.'You were born like that, and you can't alter yourself, and so
        it's no usetalking.' If you really believe this, why make any effort at all? Why not let thewhole business
        beautifully slide and yield to your instincts? What object canthere be in trying to control yourself in any manner
        whatever if you areunalterable? Assert yourself to be unalterable, and you assert yourself afatalist. Assert
        yourself a fatalist, and you free yourself from all moralresponsibility—and other people, too. Well, then, act up
        to your convictions, ifconvictions they are. If you can't alter yourself, I can't alter myself, andsupposing that
        I come along and bash you on the head and steal your purse,you can't blame me. You can only, on recovering
        consciousness, affectionatelygrasp my hand and murmur: 'Don't apologise, my dear fellow; we can't
        alterourselves.'This, you say, is absurd. It is. That is one of my innumerable points. The truthis, you do not
        really believe that you cannot alter yourself. What is the matterwith you is just what is the matter with me—sheer
        idleness. You hate gettingup in the morning, and to excuse your inexcusable indolence you talk bigabout Fate. Just
        as 'patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel,' so fatalism isthe last refuge of a shirker. But you deceive no
        one, least of all yourself. Youhave not, rationally, a leg to stand on. At this juncture, because I have madeyou
        laugh, you consent to say: 'I do try, all I can. But I can only alter myself avery little. By constitution I am
        mentally idle. I can't help that, can I?' Well, solong as you are not the only absolutely unchangeable thing in a
        universe ofchange, I don't mind. It is something for you to admit that you can alteryourself even a very little.
        The difference between our philosophies is nowonly a question of degree.In the application of any system of
        perfecting the machine, no two personswill succeed equally. From the disappointed tone of some of your criticisms
        itmight be fancied that I had advertised a system for making archangels out oftailors' dummies. Such was not my
        hope. I have no belief in miracles. But Iknow that when a thing is thoroughly well done it often has the air of
        being amiracle. My sole aim is to insist that every man shall perfect his machine tothe best of his powers, not to
        the best of somebody else's powers. I do notindulge in any hope that a man can be better than his best self. I am,
        however,convinced that every man fails to be his best self a great deal oftener than heneed fail—for the reason
        that his will-power, be it great or small, is notdirected according to the principles of common sense.Common sense
        will surely lead a man to ask the question: 'Why did myactions yesterday contradict my reason?' The reply to this
        question will nearlyalways be: 'Because at the critical moment I forgot.' The supreme explanationof the abortive
        results of so many efforts at self-alteration, the supremeexplanation of our frequent miserable scurrying into a
        doctrine of fatalism, issimple forgetfulness. It is not force that we lack, but the skill to rememberexactly what
        our reason would have us do or think at the moment itself. Howis this skill to be acquired? It can only be
        acquired, as skill at games isacquired, by practice; by the training of the organ involved to such a point thatthe
        organ acts rightly by instinct instead of wrongly by instinct. There aredegrees of success in this procedure, but
        there is no such phenomenon ascomplete failure.Habits which increase friction can be replaced by habits which
        lessen friction.Habits which arrest development can be replaced by habits which encouragedevelopment. And as a
        habit is formed naturally, so it can be formedartificially, by imitation of the unconscious process, by
        accustoming the brainto the new idea. Let me, as an example, refer again to the minor subject ofdaily friction,
        and, within that subject, to the influence of tone. A man employsa frictional tone through habit. The frictional
        tone is an instinct with him. Butif he had a quarter of an hour to reflect before speaking, and if during
        thatquarter of an hour he could always listen to arguments against the frictionaltone, his use of the frictional
        tone would rapidly diminish; his reason wouldconquer his instinct. As things are, his instinct conquers his reason
        by asurprise attack, by taking it unawares. Regular daily concentration of the brain,for a certain period, upon
        the non-frictional tone, and the immense advantagesof its use, will gradually set up in the brain a new habit of
        thinking about thenon-frictional tone; until at length the brain, disciplined, turns to the correctact before the
        old, silly instinct can capture it; and ultimately a new sagaciousinstinct will supplant the old one.This is the
        rationale. It applies to all habits. Any person can test its efficiencyin any habit. I care not whether he be of
        strong or weak will—he can test it.He will soon see the tremendous difference between merely 'making a
        goodresolution'—(he has been doing that all his life without any very brilliantconsequences)—and concentrating the
        brain for a given time exclusively upona good resolution. Concentration, the efficient mastery of the brain—all
        isthere!</p>

      <h6 style="margin-bottom: 10%;">AN INTEREST IN LIFE</h6>
      <p>After a certain period of mental discipline, of deliberate habit-forming andhabit-breaking, such as I have been
        indicating, a man will begin to acquire atany rate a superficial knowledge, a nodding acquaintance, with that
        wonderfuland mysterious affair, his brain, and he will also begin to perceive howimportant a factor in daily life
        is the control of his brain. He will assuredly besurprised at the miracles which lie between his collar and his
        hat, in that queerbox that he calls his head. For the effects that can be accomplished by meresteady, persistent
        thinking must appear to be miracles to apprentices in thepractice of thought. When once a man, having passed an
        unhappy day becausehis clumsy, negligent brain forgot to control his instincts at a critical moment,has said to
        his brain: 'I will force you, by concentrating you on that particularpoint, to act efficiently the next time
        similar circumstances arise,' and when hehas carried out his intention, and when the awkward circumstances
        haverecurred, and his brain, disciplined, has done its work, and so preventedunhappiness—then that man will regard
        his brain with a new eye. 'By Jove!'he will say; 'I've stopped one source of unhappiness, anyway. There was a
        timewhen I should have made a fool of myself in a little domestic crisis such as to-day's. But I have gone safely
        through it. I am all right. She is all right. Theatmosphere is not dangerous with undischarged electricity! And
        all becausemy brain, being in proper condition, watched firmly over my instincts! I mustkeep this up.' He will
        peer into that brain more and more. He will see moreand more of its possibilities. He will have a new and a
        supreme interest in life.A garden is a fairly interesting thing. But the cultivation of a garden is as dullas cold
        mutton compared to the cultivation of a brain; and wet weather won'tinterfere with digging, planting, and pruning
        in the box.In due season the man whose hobby is his brain will gradually settle down intoa daily routine, with
        which routine he will start the day. The idea at the back ofthe mind of the ordinary man (by the ordinary man I
        mean the man whosebrain is not his hobby) is almost always this: 'There are several things atpresent hanging over
        me—worries, unfulfilled ambitions, unrealised desires.As soon as these things are definitely settled, then I shall
        begin to live andenjoy myself.' That is the ordinary man's usual idea. He has it from his youthto his old age. He
        is invariably waiting for something to happen before hereally begins to live. I am sure that if you are an
        ordinary man (of course, youaren't, I know) you will admit that this is true of you; you exist in the hope thatone
        day things will be sufficiently smoothed out for you to begin to live. Thatis just where you differ from the man
        whose brain is his hobby. His dailyroutine consists in a meditation in the following vein: 'This day is before
        me.The circumstances of this day are my environment; they are the material out ofwhich, by means of my brain, I
        have to live and be happy and to refrain fromcausing unhappiness in other people. It is the business of my brain
        to make useof this material. My brain is in its box for that sole purpose. Not to-morrow!Not next year! Not when I
        have made my fortune! Not when my sick child isout of danger! Not when my wife has returned to her senses! Not
        when mysalary is raised! Not when I have passed that examination! Not when myindigestion is better! But now!
        To-day, exactly as to-day is! The facts of to-day, which in my unregeneracy I regarded primarily as anxieties,
        nuisances,impediments, I now regard as so much raw material from which my brain hasto weave a tissue of life that
        is comely.'And then he foresees the day as well as he can. His experience teaches himwhere he will have
        difficulty, and he administers to his brain the lessons ofwhich it will have most need. He carefully looks the
        machine over, andarranges it specially for the sort of road which he knows that it will have totraverse. And
        especially he readjusts his point of view, for his point of view iscontinually getting wrong. He is continually
        seeing worries where he ought tosee material. He may notice, for instance, a patch on the back of his head, andhe
        wonders whether it is the result of age or of disease, or whether it hasalways been there. And his wife tells him
        he must call at the chemist's andsatisfy himself at once. Frightful nuisance! Age! The endless trouble of
        acapillary complaint! Calling at the chemist's will make him late at the office!etc. etc. But then his skilled,
        efficient brain intervenes: 'What peculiarlyinteresting material this mean and petty circumstance yields for the
        practice ofphilosophy and right living!' And again: 'Isthis to ruffle you, O my soul? Willit serve any end
        whatever that I should buzz nervously round this circumstanceinstead of attending to my usual business?'I give
        this as an example of the necessity of adjusting the point of view, and ofthe manner in which a brain habituated
        by suitable concentration to correctthinking will come to the rescue in unexpected contingencies. Naturally it
        willwork with greater certainty in the manipulation of difficulties that areexpected, that can be 'seen coming ';
        and preparation for the expected is,fortunately, preparation for the unexpected. The man who commences his dayby a
        steady contemplation of the dangers which the next sixteen hours arelikely to furnish, and by arming himself
        specially against those dangers, hasthereby armed himself, though to a less extent, against dangers which he
        didnot dream of. But the routine must be fairly elastic. It may be necessary tocommence several days in
        succession—for a week or for months, even—withdisciplining the brain in one particular detail, to the temporary
        neglect of othermatters. It is astonishing how you can weed every inch of a garden path andkeep it in the most
        meticulous order, and then one morning find in the verymiddle of it a lusty, full-grown plant whose roots are
        positively mortised ingranite! All gardeners are familiar with such discoveries.But a similar discovery, though it
        entails hard labour on him, will not disgustthe man whose hobby is his brain. For the discovery in itself is part
        of thematerial out of which he has to live. If a man is to turn everything whatsoeverinto his own calm, dignity,
        and happiness, he must make this use even of hisown failures. He must look at them as phenomena of the brain in
        that box, andcheerfully set about taking measures to prevent their repetition. All thathappens to him, success or
        check, will but serve to increase his interest in thecontents of that box. I seem to hear you saying: 'And a fine
        egotist he'll be!'Well, he'll be the right sort of egotist. The average man is not half enough ofan egotist. If
        egotism means a terrific interest in one's self, egotism isabsolutely essential to efficient living. There is no
        getting away from that. Butif egotism means selfishness, the serious student of the craft of daily livingwill not
        be an egotist for more than about a year. In a year he will have provedthe ineptitude of egotism.</p>

      <h6 style="margin-bottom: 10%;">SUCCESS AND FAILURE</h6>
      <p>I am sadly aware that these brief chapters will be apt to convey, especially tothe trustful and enthusiastic
        reader, a false impression; the impression ofsimplicity; and that when experience has roughly corrected this
        impression,the said reader, unless he is most solemnly warned, may abandon the entireenterprise in a fit of
        disgust, and for ever afterwards maintain a cynical andimpolite attitude towards all theories of controlling the
        human machine. Now,the enterprise is not a simple one. It is based on one simple principle—theconscious discipline
        of the brain by selected habits of thought—but it is justabout as complicated as anything well could be. Advanced
        golf is child's playcompared to it. The man who briefly says to himself: 'I will get up at 8, andfrom 8.30 to 9 I
        will examine and control my brain, and so my life will at oncebe instantly improved out of recognition'—that man
        is destined to unpleasantsurprises. Progress will be slow. Progress may appear to be quite rapid at first,and then
        a period of futility may set in, and the would-be vanquisher of hisbrain may suffer a series of the most deadly
        defeats. And in his pessimism hemay imagine that all his pains have gone for nothing, and that the
        unseriousloungers in exhibition gardens and readers of novels in parlours are in the rightof it after all. He may
        even feel rather ashamed of himself for having been, ashe thinks, taken in by specious promises, like the
        purchaser of a quackmedicine.The conviction that great effort has been made and no progress achieved is thechief
        of the dangers that affront the beginner in machine-tending. It is, I willassert positively, in every case a
        conviction unjustified by the facts, andusually it is the mere result of reaction after fatigue, encouraged by the
        instinctfor laziness. I do not think it will survive an impartial examination; but I knowthat a man, in order to
        find an excuse for abandoning further effort, is capableof convincing himself that past effort has yielded no
        fruit at all. So curious isthe human machine. I beg every student of himself to consider this remarkwith all the
        intellectual honesty at his disposal. It is a grave warning.When the machine-tender observes that he is frequently
        changing his point ofview; when he notices that what he regarded as the kernel of the difficultyyesterday has sunk
        to a triviality to-day, being replaced by a freshphenomenon; when he arises one morning and by means of a new,
        unexpectedglimpse into the recesses of the machine perceives that hitherto he has beenquite wrong and must begin
        again; when he wonders how on earth he couldhave been so blind and so stupid as not to see what now he sees; when
        the newvision is veiled by new disappointments and narrowed by continualreservations; when he is overwhelmed by
        the complexity of his undertaking—then let him unhearten himself, for he is succeeding. The history of success
        inany art—and machine-tending is an art—is a history of recommencements, ofthe dispersal and reforming of doubts,
        of an ever-increasing conception of theextent of the territory unconquered, and an ever-decreasing conception of
        theextent of the territory conquered.It is remarkable that, though no enterprise could possibly present more
        diverseand changeful excitements than the mastering of the brain, the second greatdanger which threatens its
        ultimate success is nothing but a mere drying-up ofenthusiasm for it! One would have thought that in an affair
        which concernedhim so nearly, in an affair whose results might be in a very strict sense vital tohim, in an affair
        upon which his happiness and misery might certainly turn, aman would not weary from sheer tedium. Nevertheless, it
        is so. Again andagain I have noticed the abandonment, temporary or permanent, of this mightyand thrilling
        enterprise from simple lack of interest. And I imagine that, inpractically all cases save those in which an
        exceptional original force of willrenders the enterprise scarcely necessary, the interest in it will languish
        unlessit is regularly nourished from without. Now, the interest in it cannot benourished from without by means of
        conversation with other brain-tamers.There are certain things which may not be discussed by sanely
        organisedpeople; and this is one. The affair is too intimate, and it is also too moral. Evenafter only a few
        minutes' vocalisation on this subject a deadly infection seemsto creep into the air—the infection of priggishness.
        (Or am I mistaken, and doI fancy this horror? No; I cannot believe that I am mistaken.)Hence the nourishment must
        be obtained by reading; a little reading every day.I suppose there are some thousands of authors who have written
        with more orless sincerity on the management of the human machine. But the two which,for me, stand out easily
        above all the rest are Marcus Aurelius Antoninus andEpictetus. Not much has been discovered since their time. 'The
        perfecting oflife is a power residing in the soul,' wrote Marcus Aurelius in the ninth bookof To Himself, over
        seventeen hundred years ago. Marcus Aurelius isassuredly regarded as the greatest of writers in the human machine
        school, andnot to read him daily is considered by many to be a bad habit. As a confessionhis work stands alone.
        But as a practical 'Bradshaw' of existence, I would putthe discourses of Epictetus before M. Aurelius. Epictetus
        is grosser; he willcall you a blockhead as soon as look at you; he is witty, he is even humorous,and he never
        wanders far away from the incidents of daily life. He isbrimming over with actuality for readers of the year 1908.
        He was a freedslave. M. Aurelius was an emperor, and he had the morbidity from which allemperors must suffer. A
        finer soul than Epictetus, he is not, in my view, souseful a companion. Not all of us can breathe freely in his
        have gone throughEpictetus—a single page or paragraph per day, well masticated and digested,suffices—you can go
        through M. Aurelius, and then you can return toEpictetus, and so on, morning by morning, or night by night, till
        your life'send. And they will conserve your interest in yourself.In the matter of concentration, I hesitate to
        recommend Mrs. Annie Besant'sThought Power, and yet I should be possibly unjust if I did not recommend it,having
        regard to its immense influence on myself. It is not one of the bestbooks of this astounding woman. It is
        addressed to theosophists, and can onlybe completely understood in the light of theosophistic doctrines. (To grasp
        itall I found myself obliged to study a much larger work dealing with theosophyas a whole.) It contains an
        appreciable quantity of what strikes me as feeblesentimentalism, and also a lot of sheer dogma. But it is the
        least unsatisfactorymanual of the brain that I have met with. And if the profane reader ignores allthat is either
        Greek or twaddle to him, there will yet remain for his advantage avast amount of very sound information and
        advice. All these three books arecheap.</p>

      <h6 style="margin-bottom: 10%;">A MAN AND HIS ENVIRONMENT</h6>
      <p>I now come to an entirely different aspect of the whole subject. Hitherto I havedealt with the human machine as a
        contrivance for adapting the man to hisenvironment. My aim has been to show how much depends on the machineand how
        little depends on the environment, and that the essential business ofthe machine is to utilise, for making the
        stuff of life, the particularenvironment in which it happens to find itself—and no other! All this,however, does
        not imply that one must accept, fatalistically and permanentlyand passively, any preposterous environment into
        which destiny has chancedto throw us. If we carry far enough the discipline of our brains, we can, nodoubt, arrive
        at surprisingly good results in no matter what environment. But itwould not be 'right reason' to expend an
        excessive amount of will-power onbrain-discipline when a slighter effort in a different direction would
        produceconsequences more felicitous. A man whom fate had pitched into a canalmight accomplish miracles in the way
        of rendering himself amphibian; hemight stagger the world by the spectacle of his philosophy under
        amazingdifficulties; people might pay sixpence a head to come and see him; but hewould be less of a nincompoop if
        he climbed out and arranged to livedefinitely on the bank.The advantage of an adequate study of the control of the
        machine, such as Ihave outlined, is that it enables the student to judge, with some certainty,whether the
        unsatisfactoriness of his life is caused by a disordered machine orby an environment for which the machine is, in
        its fundamental construction,unsuitable. It does help him to decide justly whether, in the case of a
        gravedifference between them, he, or the rest of the universe, is in the wrong. Andalso, if he decides that he is
        not in the wrong, it helps him to choose a newenvironment, or to modify the old, upon some scientific principle.
        The vastmajority of people never know, with any precision, why they are dissatisfiedwith their sojourn on this
        planet. They make long and fatiguing excursions insearch of precious materials which all the while are concealed
        in their ownbreasts. They don't know what they want; they only know that they wantsomething. Or, if they contrive
        to settle in their own minds what they do want,a hundred to one the obtaining of it will leave them just as far
        off contentmentas they were at the beginning! This is a matter of daily observation: thatpeople are frantically
        engaged in attempting to get hold of things which, byuniversal experience, are hideously disappointing to those
        who have obtainedpossession of them. And still the struggle goes on, and probably will go on.All because brains
        are lying idle! 'It is no trifle that is at stake,' said Epictetusas to the question of control of instinct by
        reason. 'It means, Are you in yoursenses or are you not?' In this significance, indubitably the vast majority
        ofpeople are not in their senses; otherwise they would not behave as they do, sovaguely, so happy-go-luckily, so
        blindly. But the man whose brain is inworking order emphatically is in his senses.And when a man, by means of the
        efficiency of his brain, has put his reason indefinite command over his instincts, he at once sees things in a
        truerperspective than was before possible, and therefore he is able to set a justvalue upon the various parts
        which go to make up his environment. If, forinstance, he lives in London, and is aware of constant friction, he
        will be led toexamine the claims of London as a Mecca for intelligent persons. He may sayto himself: 'There is
        something wrong, and the seat of trouble is not in themachine. London compels me to tolerate dirt, darkness,
        ugliness, strain,tedious daily journeyings, and general expensiveness. What does London giveme in exchange?' And
        he may decide that, as London offers him nothingspecial in exchange except the glamour of London and an occasional
        seat at agood concert or a bad play, he may get a better return for his expenditure ofbrains, nerves, and money in
        the provinces. He may perceive, with a certainFrench novelist, that 'most people of truly distinguished mind
        prefer theprovinces.' And he may then actually, in obedience to reason, quit thedeceptions of London with a
        tranquil heart, sure of his diagnosis. Whereas aman who had not devoted much time to the care of his mental
        machinerycould not screw himself up to the step, partly from lack of resolution, andpartly because he had never
        examined the sources of his unhappiness. A manwho, not having full control of his machine, is consistently
        dissatisfied withhis existence, is like a man who is being secretly poisoned and cannot decidewith what or by
        whom. And so he has no middle course between absolutestarvation and a continuance of poisoning.As with the
        environment of place, so with the environment of individuals.Most friction between individuals is avoidable
        friction; sometimes, however,friction springs from such deep causes that no skill in the machine can doaway with
        it. But how is the man whose brain is not in command of hisexistence to judge whether the unpleasantness can be
        cured or not, whether itarises in himself or in the other? He simply cannot judge. Whereas a man whokeeps his
        brain for use and not for idle amusement will, when he sees thatfriction persists in spite of his brain, be so
        clearly impressed by theadvisability of separation as the sole cure that he will steel himself to the
        effortnecessary for a separation. One of the chief advantages of an efficient brain isthat an efficient brain is
        capable of acting with firmness and resolution, partly,of course, because it has been toned up, but more because
        its operations arenot confused by the interference of mere instincts.Thirdly, there is the environment of one's
        general purpose in life, which is, Ifeel convinced, far more often hopelessly wrong and futile than either
        theenvironment of situation or the environment of individuals. I will be boldenough to say that quite seventy per
        cent. of ambition is never realised at all,and that ninety-nine per cent. of all realised ambition is fruitless.
        In otherwords, that a gigantic sacrifice of the present to the future is always going on.And here again the
        utility of brain-discipline is most strikingly shown. A manwhose first business it is every day to concentrate his
        mind on the properperformance of that particular day, must necessarily conserve his interest inthe present. It is
        impossible that his perspective should become so warped thathe will devote, say, fifty-five years of his career to
        problematical preparationsfor his comfort and his glory during the final ten years. A man whose brain ishis
        servant, and not his lady-help or his pet dog, will be in receipt of such dailycontent and satisfaction that he
        will early ask himself the question: 'As for thisambition that is eating away my hours, what will it give me that
        I have notalready got?' Further, the steady development of interest in the hobby (call it!)of common-sense daily
        living will act as an automatic test of any ambition. Ifan ambition survives and flourishes on the top of that
        daily cultivation of themachine, then the owner of the ambition may be sure that it is a genuine andan invincible
        ambition, and he may pursue it in full faith; his developed carefor the present will prevent him from making his
        ambition an altar on whichthe whole of the present is to be offered up.I shall be told that I want to do away with
        ambition, and that ambition is thegreat motive-power of existence, and that therefore I am an enemy of societyand
        the truth is not in me. But I do not want to do away with ambition. What Isay is that current ambitions usually
        result in disappointment, that they usuallymean the complete distortion of a life. This is an incontestable fact,
        and thereason of it is that ambitions are chosen either without knowledge of their realvalue or without knowledge
        of what they will cost. A disciplined brain will atonce show the unnecessariness of most ambitions, and will
        ensure that theremainder shall be conducted with reason. It will also convince its possessorthat the ambition to
        live strictly according to the highest common sense duringthe next twenty-four hours is an ambition that needs a
        lot of beating.</p>

      <p>Anybody who really wishes to talk simple truth about money at the presenttime is confronted by a very serious
        practical difficulty. He must put himself inopposition to the overwhelming body of public opinion, and resign
        himself tobeing regarded either as a poseur, a crank, or a fool. The public is in search ofhappiness now, as it
        was a million years ago. Money is not the principal factorin happiness. It may be argued whether, as a factor in
        happiness, money is oftwentieth-rate importance or fiftieth-rate importance. But it cannot be arguedwhether money,
        in point of fact, does or does not of itself bring happiness.There can be no doubt whatever that money does not
        bring happiness. Yet, inface of this incontrovertible and universal truth, the whole public behavesexactly as if
        money were the sole or the principal preliminary to happiness.The public does not reason, and it will not listen
        to reason; its blood is up inthe money-hunt, and the philosopher might as well expostulate with anearthquake as
        try to take that public by the button-hole and explain. If a mansacrifices his interest under the will of some
        dead social tyrant in order tomarry whom he wishes, if an English minister of religion declines
        twenty-fivethousand dollars a year to go into exile and preach to New York millionaires,the phenomenon is
        genuinely held to be so astounding that it at once flies rightround the world in the form of exclamatory newspaper
        articles! In an agewhen such an attitude towards money is sincere, it is positively dangerous—Idoubt if it may not
        be harmful—to persist with loud obstinacy that money,instead of being the greatest, is the least thing in the
        world. In times of highmilitary excitement a man may be ostracised if not lynched for utteringopinions which
        everybody will accept as truisms a couple of years later, andthus the wise philosopher holds his tongue—lest it
        should be cut out. So at thezenith of a period when the possession of money in absurd masses is aninfallible means
        to the general respect, I have no intention either of preachingor of practising quite all that I privately in the
        matter of riches.It was not always thus. Though there have been previous ages as lustful forwealth and ostentation
        as our own, there have also been ages when money-getting and millionaire-envying were not the sole preoccupations
        of theaverage man. And such an age will undoubtedly succeed to ours. Few thingswould surprise me less, in social
        life, than the upspringing of some anti-luxurymovement, the formation of some league or guild among the middling
        classes(where alone intellect is to be found in quantity), the members of which wouldbind themselves to stand
        aloof from all the great, silly, banal, ugly, and tediousluxe-activities of the time and not to spend more than a
        certain sum per annumon eating, drinking, covering their bodies, and being moved about like parcelsfrom one spot
        of the earth's surface to another. Such a movement would, andwill, help towards the formation of an opinion which
        would condemn lavishexpenditure on personal satisfactions as bad form. However, the shareholdersof grand hotels,
        restaurants, and race-courses of all sorts, together with popularsingers and barristers, etc., need feel no
        immediate alarm. The movement isnot yet.As touching the effect of money on the efficient ordering of the
        humanmachine, there is happily no necessity to inform those who have begun tointerest themselves in the conduct of
        their own brains that money counts forvery little in that paramount affair. Nothing that really helps
        towardsperfection costs more than is within the means of every person who readsthese pages. The expenses connected
        with daily meditation, with the building-up of mental habits, with the practice of self-control and of
        cheerfulness, withthe enthronement of reason over the rabble of primeval instincts—theseexpenses are really, you
        know, trifling. And whether you get that well-deserved rise of a pound a week or whether you don't, you may anyhow
        goahead with the machine; it isn't a motor-car, though I started by comparing itto one. And even when, having to a
        certain extent mastered, through sensiblemanagement of the machine, the art of achieving a daily content and
        dignity,you come to the embroidery of life—even the best embroidery of life is notabsolutely ruinous. Meat may go
        up in price—it has done—but books won't.Admission to picture galleries and concerts and so forth will remain quite
        low.The views from Richmond Hill or Hindhead, or along Pall Mall at sunset, thesmell of the earth, the taste of
        fruit and of kisses—these things are unaffectedby the machinations of trusts and the hysteria of stock exchanges.
        Travel,which after books is the finest of all embroideries (and which is not to bevalued by the mile but by the
        quality), is decidedly cheaper than ever it was.All that is required is ingenuity in one's expenditure. And much
        ingenuity witha little money is vastly more profitable and amusing than much money withoutingenuity.And all the
        while as you read this you are saying, with your impatient sneer:'It's all very well; it's all very fine talking,
        but ...' In brief, you are notconvinced. You cannot deracinate that wide-rooted dogma within your soulthat more
        money means more joy. I regret it. But let me put one question, andlet me ask you to answer it honestly. Your
        financial means are greater nowthan they used to be. Are you happier or less discontented than you used to
        be?Taking your existence day by day, hour by hour, judging it by the mysteriousfeel (in the chest) of
        responsibilities, worries, positive joys and satisfactions,are you genuinely happier than you used to be?I do not
        wish to be misunderstood. The financial question cannot be ignored.If it is true that money does not bring
        happiness, it is no less true that the lackof money induces a state of affairs in which efficient living becomes
        doublydifficult. These two propositions, superficially perhaps self-contradictory, arenot really so. A modest
        income suffices for the fullest realisation of the Ego interms of content and dignity; but you must live within
        it. You cannotrighteously ignore money. A man, for instance, who cultivates himself andinstructs a family of
        daughters in everything except the ability to earn theirown livelihood, and then has the impudence to die suddenly
        without leaving apenny—that man is a scoundrel. Ninety—or should I say ninety-nine?—percent. of all those
        anxieties which render proper living almost impossible arecaused by the habit of walking on the edge of one's
        income as one might walkon the edge of a precipice. The majority of Englishmen have some financialworry or other
        continually, everlastingly at the back of their minds. Thesacrifice necessary to abolish this condition of things
        is more apparent thanreal. All spending is a matter of habit.Speaking generally, a man can contrive, out of an
        extremely modest income,to have all that he needs—unless he needs the esteem of snobs. Habit may, andhabit usually
        does, make it just as difficult to keep a family on two thousand ayear as on two hundred. I suppose that for the
        majority of men the suspensionof income for a single month would mean either bankruptcy, the usurer, oracute
        inconvenience. Impossible, under such circumstances, to be in full andindependent possession of one's immortal
        soul! Hence I should be inclined tosay that the first preliminary to a proper control of the machine is the habit
        ofspending decidedly less than one earns or receives. The veriest automaton of aclerk ought to have the
        wherewithal of a whole year as a shield against thecaprices of his employer. It would be as reasonable to expect
        the inhabitants ofan unfortified city in the midst of a plain occupied by a hostile army to applythemselves
        successfully to the study of logarithms or metaphysics, as to expecta man without a year's income in his safe to
        apply himself successfully to thetrue art of living.And the whole secret of relative freedom from financial
        anxiety lies not inincome, but in expenditure. I am ashamed to utter this antique platitude. But,like most
        aphorisms of unassailable wisdom, it is completely ignored. You say,of course, that it is not easy to leave a
        margin between your expenditure andyour present income. I know it. I fraternally shake your hand. Still it is,
        inmost cases, far easier to lessen one's expenditure than to increase one's incomewithout increasing one's
        expenditure. The alternative is before you. Howeveryou decide, be assured that the foundation of philosophy is a
        margin, and thatthe margin can always be had.</p>

      <h6 style="margin-bottom: 10%;">REASON, REASON!</h6>
      <p>In conclusion, I must insist upon several results of what I may call the'intensive culture' of the reason. The
        brain will not only grow more effectivelypowerful in the departments of life where the brain is supposed specially
        towork, but it will also enlarge the circle of its activities. It will assuredlyinterfere in everything. The
        student of himself must necessarily conduct hisexistence more and more according to the views of his brain. This
        will be mostsalutary and agreeable both for himself and for the rest of the world. Youobject. You say it will be a
        pity when mankind refers everything to reason.You talk about the heart. You envisage an entirely reasonable
        existence as aharsh and callous existence. Not so. When the reason and the heart come intoconflict the heart is
        invariably wrong. I do not say that the reason is alwaysentirely right, but I do say that it is always less wrong
        than the heart. Theempire of the reason is not universal, but within its empire reason is supreme,and if other
        forces challenge it on its own soil they must take theconsequences. Nearly always, when the heart opposes the
        brain, the heart ismerely a pretty name which we give to our idleness and our egotism.We pass along the Strand and
        see a respectable young widow standing in thegutter, with a baby in her arms and a couple of boxes of matches in
        one hand.We know she is a widow because of her weeds, and we know she isrespectable by her clothes. We know she is
        not begging because she is sellingmatches. The sight of her in the gutter pains our heart. Our heart weeps
        andgives the woman a penny in exchange for a halfpenny box of matches, and thepain of our heart is thereby
        assuaged. Our heart has performed a good action.But later on our reason (unfortunately asleep at the moment) wakes
        up andsays: 'That baby was hired; the weeds and matches merely a dodge. The wholeaffair was a spectacle got up to
        extract money from a fool like you. It is asmechanical as a penny in the slot. Instead of relieving distress you
        have simplyhelped to perpetuate an infamous system. You ought to know that you can't dogood in that offhand way.'
        The heart gives pennies in the street. The brain runsthe Charity Organisation Society. Of course, to give pennies
        in the street ismuch less trouble than to run the C.O.S. As a method of producing a quick,inexpensive, and
        pleasing effect on one's egotism the C.O.S. is simply not in itwith this dodge of giving pennies at random,
        without inquiry. Only—which ofthe two devices ought to be accused of harshness and callousness? Which ofthem is
        truly kind? I bring forward the respectable young widow as a samplecase of the Heart v. Brain conflict. All other
        cases are the same. The brain isalways more kind than the heart; the brain is always more willing than theheart to
        put itself to a great deal of trouble for a very little reward; the brainalways does the difficult, unselfish
        thing, and the heart always does the facile,showy thing. Naturally the result of the brain's activity on society
        is alwaysmore advantageous than the result of the heart's activity.Another point. I have tried to show that, if
        the reason is put in command of thefeelings, it is impossible to assume an attitude of blame towards any
        personwhatsoever for any act whatsoever. The habit of blaming must departabsolutely. It is no argument against
        this statement that it involves anarchy andthe demolition of society. Even if it did (which emphatically it does
        not), thatwould not affect its truth. All great truths have been assailed on the groundthat to accept them meant
        the end of everything. As if that mattered! As Imake no claim to be the discoverer of this truth I have no
        hesitation inannouncing it to be one of the most important truths that the world has yet tolearn. However, the
        real reason why many people object to this truth is notbecause they think it involves the utter demolition of
        society (fear of the utterdemolition of society never stopped any one from doing or believing anything,and never
        will), but because they say to themselves that if they can't blamethey can't praise. And they do so like praising!
        If they are so desperately fondof praising, it is a pity that they don't praise a little more! There can be
        nodoubt that the average man blames much more than he praises. His instinct isto blame. If he is satisfied he says
        nothing; if he is not, he most illogicallykicks up a row. So that even if the suppression of blame involved
        thesuppression of praise the change would certainly be a change for the better.But I can perceive no reason why
        the suppression of blame should involve thesuppression of praise. On the contrary, I think that the habit of
        praising shouldbe fostered. (I do not suggest the occasional use of trowels, but the regular useof salt-spoons.)
        Anyhow, the triumph of the brain over the natural instincts (inan ideally organised man the brain and the natural
        instincts will never haveeven a tiff) always means the ultimate triumph of kindness.And, further, the culture of
        the brain, the constant disciplinary exercise of thereasoning faculty, means the diminution of misdeeds. (Do not
        imagine I amhinting that you are on the verge of murdering your wife or breaking into yourneighbour's house.
        Although you personally are guiltless, there is a good dealof sin still committed in your immediate vicinity.)
        Said Balzac in La CousineBette, 'A crime is in the first instance a defect of reasoning powers.' In
        theappreciation of this truth, Marcus Aurelius was, as usual, a bit beforehand withBalzac. M. Aurelius said, 'No
        soul wilfully misses truth.' And Epictetus hadcome to the same conclusion before M. Aurelius, and Plato before
        Epictetus.All wrong-doing is done in the sincere belief that it is the best thing to do.Whatever sin a man does he
        does either for his own benefit or for the benefitof society. At the moment of doing it he is convinced that it is
        the only thing todo. He is mistaken. And he is mistaken because his brain has been unequal tothe task of reasoning
        the matter out. Passion (the heart) is responsible for allcrimes. Indeed, crime is simply a convenient
        monosyllable which we apply towhat happens when the brain and the heart come into conflict and the brain
        isdefeated. That transaction of the matches was a crime, you know.Lastly, the culture of the brain must result in
        the habit of originally examiningall the phenomena of life and conduct, to see what they really are, and to
        whatthey lead. The heart hates progress, because the dear old thing always wants todo as has always been done. The
        heart is convinced that custom is a virtue.The heart of the dirty working man rebels when the State insists that
        he shallbe clean, for no other reason than that it is his custom to be dirty. Useless totell his heart that,
        clean, he will live longer! He has been dirty and he will be.The brain alone is the enemy of prejudice and
        precedent, which alone are theenemies of progress. And this habit of originally examining phenomena isperhaps the
        greatest factor that goes to the making of personal dignity; for itfosters reliance on one's self and courage to
        accept the consequences of the actof reasoning. Reason is the basis of personal dignity.I finish. I have said
        nothing of the modifications which the constant use of thebrain will bring about in the general value of
        existence. Modifications slowand subtle, but tremendous! The persevering will discover them. It will happento the
        persevering that their whole lives are changed—texture and colour, too!Naught will happen to those who do not
        persevere.</p>
