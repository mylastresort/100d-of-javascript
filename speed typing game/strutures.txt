////make all letters with red starting from the right ones in the word with black or white




//to test each word
////split the value of the textarea due to the space key

////block the last word if the match condition is true


//to calculate the score
////counting the charachters on the right words array plus (length-1) of space key 
////perform the equation:take the numbers of the charachters and devide it by the time spent
